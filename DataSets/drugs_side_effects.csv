Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine,Covid 19,"hives , rash, dizziness , weakness, fast heartbeats; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Your vaccination provider may want to watch you for a short time after your shot, to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction. You will be treated quickly if you have a reaction right after you receive the vaccine. You should not receive this vaccine again if the first shot caused a severe allergic reaction. Your doctor or vaccination provider will determine if you can safely receive another COVID-19 vaccine. Becoming infected with COVID-19 is much more dangerous to your health than receiving Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Some people receiving Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine had inflammation of the heart muscle or the lining around the heart within a few days after receiving this vaccine, but the risk of this side effect is very low.

bamlanivimab and etesevimab,Covid 19,"Possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab include: Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after infusion with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reactions: fever, chills, nausea, headache, shortness of breath, low or high blood pressure, rapid or slow heart rate, chest discomfort or pain, weakness, confusion, feeling tired, wheezing, swelling of your lips, face, or throat, rash including hives, itching, muscle aches, dizziness, and sweating. These reactions may be severe or life threatening. Worsening symptoms after treatment: You may experience new or worsening symptoms after infusion, including fever, difficulty breathing, rapid or slow heart rate, tiredness, weakness or confusion. If these occur, contact your healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention as some of these events have required hospitalization. It is unknown if these events are related to treatment or are due to the progression of COVID-19. The side effects of getting any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the infusion site. These are not all the possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Not a lot of people have been given bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time. It is possible that bamlanivimab and etesevimab could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, bamlanivimab and etesevimab may reduce your body's immune response to a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Specific studies have not been conducted to address these possible risks. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions. What other treatment choices are there? Like bamlanivimab and etesevimab, FDA may allow for the emergency use of other medicines to treat people with COVID-19. Go to https://www.drugs.com/condition/covid-19.html for information on medicines available to treat people with COVID-19. Your healthcare provider may talk with you about clinical trials you may be eligible for. It is your choice to be treated or not to be treated with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Should you decide not to receive bamlanivimab and etesevimab or stop it at any time, it will not change your standard medical care. Pregnancy or Breastfeeding There is limited experience treating pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. For a mother and unborn baby, the benefit of receiving bamlanivimab and etesevimab may be greater than the risk from the treatment. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options and specific situation with your healthcare provider. How do I report side effects with bamlanivimab and etesevimab? Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.

bebtelovimab,Covid 19,"Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after injection with bebtelovimab. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you or your child develop any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reaction: fever difficulty breathing low oxygen level in your blood chills tiredness fast or slow heart rate chest discomfort or pain weakness confusion nausea headache shortness of breath low or high blood pressure wheezing swelling of your lips, face, or throat rash including hives itching muscle aches dizziness feeling faint, and sweating. These reactions may be severe or life threatening. Common side effects include infusion-related reactions, pruritus, and rash. The side effects of receiving any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the injection site. These are not all the possible side effects. Not many people have received bebtelovimab. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. All of the risks are not known at this time. Contact your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away.

It is possible that bebtelovimab could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Comirnaty,Covid 19,"Comirnaty may cause severe side effects including: Allergic reactions. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: Difficulty breathing Swelling of your face and throat A fast heartbeat A bad rash all over your body Dizziness and weakness Myocarditis and pericarditis. Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) is a rare side effect and has have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of vaccine and most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine: Chest pain Shortness of breath Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart Side effects can include: severe allergic reactions non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) injection site pain tiredness headache muscle pain chills joint pain fever injection site swelling injection site redness nausea feeling unwell swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) diarrhea vomiting arm pain These may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur. The possible side effects of the vaccine are still being studied in clinical trials. If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 911, or go to the nearest hospital. Call the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. Report vaccine side effects to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1-800-822-7967 or report online to https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.
