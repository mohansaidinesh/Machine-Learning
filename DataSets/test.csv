"Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as o 2 or f2, are called what?",residues,antioxidants,Oxygen,oxidants,"Oxidants and Reductants Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as O 2 or F2, are calledoxidants (or oxidizing agents) because they can oxidize other compounds. In the process of accepting electrons, an oxidant is reduced. Compounds that are capable of donating electrons, such as sodium metal or cyclohexane (C6H12), are calledreductants (or reducing agents) because they can cause the reduction of another compound. In the process of donating electrons, a reductant is oxidized. These relationships are summarized in Equation 3.30: Equation 3.30 Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books."
What term in biotechnology means a genetically exact copy of an organism?,phenotype,adult,male,clone,"But transgenic animals just have one novel gene. What about an animal with a whole new genome? Could a clone , a genetically exact copy of an organism, be developed using techniques associated with biotechnology? It could be argued that human cloning is one of the inevitable outcomes of modern biotechnology. It ""simply"" involves the removal of the nucleus from a somatic cell and its placement into an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed. This new cell would mimic the zygote, the first diploid cell of a new organism. This new zygote is allowed to become established, and a few days later is placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother. Theoretically this would result in an individual genetically identical to the donor. Obviously, there are many ethical and legal issues associated with human cloning, and of course, it is not a ""simple"" procedure. But animal cloning is arguably a different story."
Vertebrata are characterized by the presence of what?,Thumbs,Bones,Muscles,backbone,"Figure 29.7 Vertebrata are characterized by the presence of a backbone, such as the one that runs through the middle of this fish. All vertebrates are in the Craniata clade and have a cranium. (credit: Ernest V. More; taken at Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, Washington, D."
What is the height above or below sea level called?,variation,depth,latitude,elevation,"As you know, the surface of Earth is not flat. Some places are high, and some places are low. For example, mountain ranges like the Sierra Nevada in California or the Andes in South America are high above the surrounding areas. An accurate location must take into account the third dimension. Elevation is the height above or below sea level. Sea level refers to the height of the ocean’s surface. This is the midpoint between high and low tide. Sea level can vary from place to place, but scientists base their elevation measurements on the average, or mean, sea level to make sure they have a standard reference point."
"Ice cores, varves and what else indicate the environmental conditions at the time of their creation?",magma,mountain ranges,fossils,tree rings,"Tree rings, ice cores, and varves indicate the environmental conditions at the time they were made."
What chemical signals in plants control different processes?,Human Hormones,produce hormones,nitrogen hormones,plant hormones,Plant hormones are chemical signals that control different processes in plants.
"Meiosis is part of the process of gametogenesis, which is the production of what?",sperm only,chromosomes,egg only,sperm and eggs,"Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis) Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell’s life cycle. Meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells. The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis. Spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules, with the most primitive cells at the periphery of the tube and the most mature sperm at the lumen of the tube (Figure 18.14). Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells. These stem cells, each called a spermatogonium (pl. spermatogonia), go through mitosis to produce one cell that remains as a stem cell and a second cell called a primary spermatocyte that will undergo meiosis to produce sperm. The diploid primary spermatocyte goes through meiosis I to produce two haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte divides after meiosis II to produce two cells called spermatids. The spermatids eventually reach the lumen of the tubule and grow a flagellum, becoming sperm cells. Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis."
Which type of tree is dominant in temperate forests?,shrubs,vines,fungus,deciduous,Figure 44.18 Deciduous trees are the dominant plant in the temperate forest. (credit: Oliver Herold).
What kind of viscosity is found in long-chain hydrocarbons?,intense viscosity,increased viscosity,low viscosity,highly viscous,"There is also a correlation between viscosity and molecular shape. Liquids consisting of long, flexible molecules tend to have higher viscosities than those composed of more spherical or shorter-chain molecules. The longer the molecules, the easier it is for them to become “tangled” with one another, making it more difficult for them to move past one another. London dispersion forces also increase with chain length. Due to a combination of these two effects, long-chain hydrocarbons (such as motor oils) are highly viscous."
Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in this?,occasional array,incorrect array,normal array,regular array,"Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in a regular array. The lattice energy (U) of an ionic substance is defined as the energy required to dissociate the solid into gaseous ions; U can be calculated from the charges on the ions, the arrangement of the ions in the solid, and the internuclear distance. Because U depends on the product of the ionic charges, substances with dior tripositive cations and/or di- or trinegative anions tend to have higher lattice energies than their singly charged counterparts. Higher lattice energies typically result in higher melting points and increased hardnessbecause more thermal energy is needed to overcome the forces that hold the ions together. Lattice energies cannot be measured directly but are obtained from a thermochemical cycle called the Born–Haber cycle, in which Hess’s law is used to calculate the lattice energy from the measured enthalpy of formation of the ionic compound, along with other thermochemical data. The Born–Haber cycle can be used to predict which ionic compounds are likely to form. Sublimation, the conversion of a solid directly to a gas, has an accompanying enthalpy change called the enthalpy of sublimation."
About how tall can mid-ocean ridges be?,2 inches,about 2 meters,about 2 feet,about 2 km,"Besides seamounts, there are long, very tall (about 2 km) mountain ranges. These ranges are connected so that they form huge ridge systems called mid-ocean ridges ( Figure below ). The mid-ocean ridges form from volcanic eruptions. Lava from inside Earth breaks through the crust and creates the mountains."
What are by far the most common type of invertebrate?,corals,spiders,crustaceans,insects,"This Monarch caterpillar is an invertebrate. It is also an insect and an arthropod. Of all the animal species, it is estimated that well over 90% are invertebrates. Of all invertebrates, the insects are by far the most numerous. There are so many species of insects that scientists have yet to discover them all, let alone name or count them. Estimates of the total number of insect species fall in the range of 1 to 30 million. So, it helps if there are methods to classify not just the insects, but all invertebrates."

"Only about one percent of plants have lost what ability, turning them into consumers and even predators, instead of producers?",growth,flowering,rooting,photosynthesis,"Almost all plants make food by photosynthesis . Only about 1 percent of the estimated 300,000 species of plants have lost the ability to photosynthesize. These other species are consumers, many of them predators. How do plants prey on other organisms? The Venus fly trap in Figure below shows one way this occurs."
How does a neon light produce visible light?,mitosis,luminescence,radiation,electroluminescence,"A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb is a glass tube that contains the noble gas neon. When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, causing them to give off visible light. Neon produces red light. Other noble gases are also used in lights, and they produce light of different colors. For example, krypton produces violet light, and argon produces blue light."
The bird ancestor that lived in trees developed what feature commonly associated with birds?,beaks,tails,webbed feet,wings,"Wings evolved in a bird ancestor that lived in trees. Thus, wings are modified arms that helped the animal glide from branch to branch."
What do most living things use to make atp from glucose?,nitrogen,enzymes,carbon,oxygen,"Today, most living things use oxygen to make ATP from glucose. However, many living things can also make ATP without oxygen. This is true of some plants and fungi and also of many bacteria. These organisms use aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but when oxygen is in short supply, they use anaerobic respiration instead. Certain bacteria can only use anaerobic respiration. In fact, they may not be able to survive at all in the presence of oxygen."
What are the two most common silicates?,Micas	 and quartz,Olivine and quartz,Micas	 and feldspar,feldspar and quartz,"Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicates.

What term means the amount of water vapor in the air?,ambient,temperature,pressure,humidity,Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.
Paracrine signals move by what method through the extracellular matrix?,transfusion,osmosis,deposition,diffusion,"Paracrine Signaling Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. Paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time. In order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (Figure 9.3). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, Take your hand off the stove! When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal."
"Presence of a cell wall, large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids distinguish what type of cell?",heterotroph,animal,reproductive,plant,"All but one of the structures described above are found in plant cells as well as animal cells. The only exception is centrioles, which are not found in plant cells. Plant cells have three additional structures that are not found in animals cells. These include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids. You can see these structures in the model of a plant cell in Figure below . You can also see them in the interactive plant cell at this link:."

What are people with osteoporosis at increased risk of?,growth spurt,epilepsy,senility,bone fractures,"For a long time, scientists considered fungi to be members of the plant kingdom because they have obvious similarities with plants. Both fungi and plants are immobile, have cell walls, and grow in soil. Some fungi, such as lichens , even look like plants (see Figure below )."
Where is energy stored in a chemical substance?,inside atoms,on the surface,in molecules,between atoms,energy that is stored in the connections between atoms in a chemical substance.
"By the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the united states will be 60 years of age or older. the cdc estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of this?",blood vessels,respiratory system,cardiovascular system,immune system,"Immune System By the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the United States will be 60 years of age or older. The CDC estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. This loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. To treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. One major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. Animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. There is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of naïve T cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the FOXN1 gene with age. It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve T cells high. Gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. The more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. The ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones."
"Upon death of an organism, during composition, what returns to the soil as ammonium ions?",hydrogen,potasium,calcium,nitrogen,"When organisms die and decompose, their nitrogen is returned to the soil as ammonium ions. Nitrifying bacteria change some of the ammonium ions into nitrates."
Most insects reproduce quickly and through what type of reproduction?,asexual reproduction,spores,photosynthesis,sexual reproduction,"Most insects can reproduce very quickly within a short period of time. With a short generation time, they evolve faster and can quickly adjust to environmental changes. Most insects reproduce by sexual reproduction . The female produces eggs, which are fertilized by the male, and then the eggs are usually placed near the required food. In some insects, there is asexual reproduction during which the offspring come from a single parent. In this type of reproduction, the offspring are almost identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects."
Digestion of proteins begins with acids in what organ?,brain,colon,liver,stomach,"24.4 Protein Metabolism Digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, where HCl and pepsin begin the process of breaking down proteins into their constituent amino acids. As the chyme enters the small intestine, it mixes with bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. The bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic HCl, and the digestive enzymes break down the proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. Digestive hormones secretin and CCK are released from the small intestine to aid in digestive processes, and digestive proenzymes are released from the pancreas (trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen). Enterokinase, an enzyme located in the wall of the small intestine, activates trypsin, which in turn activates chymotrypsin. These enzymes liberate the individual amino acids that are then transported via sodium-amino acid transporters across the intestinal wall into the cell. The amino acids are then transported into the bloodstream for dispersal to the liver and cells throughout the body to be used to create new proteins. When in excess, the amino acids are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. The nitrogen waste that is liberated in this process is converted to urea in the urea acid cycle and eliminated in the urine. In times of starvation, amino acids can be used as an energy source and processed through the Krebs cycle."
"Many species of rotifers exhibit haplodiploidy, which is a method of what?",respiration,circulation,digestion,gender determination,"Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege. org/l/rotifers) to see rotifers feeding. Rotifers are pseudocoelomates commonly found in fresh water and some salt water environments throughout the world. Figure 28.17 shows the anatomy of a rotifer belonging to class Bdelloidea. About 2,200 species of rotifers have been identified. Rotifers are dioecious organisms (having either male or female genitalia) and exhibit sexual dimorphism (males and females have different forms). Many species are parthenogenic and exhibit haplodiploidy, a method of gender determination in which a fertilized egg develops into a female and an unfertilized egg develops into a male. In many dioecious species, males are short-lived and smaller with no digestive system and a single testis. Females can produce eggs that are capable of dormancy for protection during harsh environmental conditions."
What is the most abundant metal of the earth's crust?,magnetite,calcium,copper,aluminum,"Metals represent approximately 25% of the elemental makeup of the Earth's crust. The bulk of these metals, primarily aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, are typically found in combined form. The most abundant metal is aluminum, which occurs almost exclusively as the ionic mineral bauxite. The other most common metals, including iron, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, are also found primarily as the cationic portion of an ionic compound. Very few metals actually occur naturally as pure substances. The ones that do are often referred to as precious or semi-precious metals."

Estimate the diameter of the pupil. Now turn off the lights and darken the room. After a few minutes turn on the lights and promptly estimate the diameter of the pupil. What happens to the pupil as the eye adjusts to the room light? Explain your observations. The eye can detect an impressive amount of detail, considering how small the image is on the retina. To get some idea of how small the image can be, consider the following example."
"The body cannot sustain for very long the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones associated with what stress response?",sink-or-swim,do-or-die,fainting,fight-or-flight,"Watch this Discovery Channel animation (http://openstaxcollege. org/l/adrenaline) describing the flight-or-flight response. Long-term Stress Response Long-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. Instead, other hormones come into play. In a long-term stress response, the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells. They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism. There are two main corticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue. The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production. The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis. Glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. For example, cortisone is used as an anti-inflammatory medication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due to its immune-suppressing effects. Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume. Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing’s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body. This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood. Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison’s disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin, hypoglycemia, and low electrolyte levels in the blood."
"What system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex?",lipids system,vasculature system,ventrical system,vestibular system,"14.2 Central Processing Sensory input to the brain enters through pathways that travel through either the spinal cord (for somatosensory input from the body) or the brain stem (for everything else, except the visual and olfactory systems) to reach the diencephalon. In the diencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus. This is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes. The two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. The major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways. The auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. Sound localization is made possible through the activity of these brain stem structures. The vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. The visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other side of the brain. Within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal. The ventral visual stream connects to structures in the temporal lobe that are important for long-term memory formation. The dorsal visual stream interacts with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and together they can influence the activity in the frontal lobe to generate movements of the body in relation to visual information."

"The products of what process are needed for cellular respiration, and vice versa?",circulation,digestion,spermatogenesis,photosynthesis,"Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are like two sides of the same coin. This is clear from the diagram in Figure below . The products of photosynthesis are needed for cellular respiration. The products of cellular respiration are needed for photosynthesis. Together, the two processes store and release energy in virtually all living things."
Most fungi get organic compounds from what?,carnivorous organisms,inorganic material,living organisms,dead organisms,"Most fungi get organic compounds from dead organisms. They are decomposers called saprotrophs. A saprotroph feeds on any remaining organic matter after other decomposers do their work. Fungi use enzymes to digest organic remains and then absorb the resulting organic compounds. As decomposers, fungi are vital for the health of ecosystems. They break down nonliving organic matter and release the nutrients into the soil. Plants can then use the nutrients and pass them on to herbivores and other consumers."
How do very massive stars end their lives?,consumed by black hole,become super novas,explode,become red supergiants,"A more massive star ends its life in a more dramatic way. Very massive stars become red supergiants . Unlike a red giant, when all the helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms up to iron atoms. Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces. For this reason, stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more elements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and collapses."
Pairs of nitrogenous bases are attached to each other by?,magnetism,potassium bonds,ionic bonds,hydrogen bonds,
Rupture can cause fragments of what to travel via the bloodstream and become lodged in other arteries?,white blood cells,enamel,red blood cells,plaque,
The strength of a base depends on the concentration of _______ it produces when dissolved in water?,monoxide ions,combustion ions,calcium ions,hydroxide ions,"The strength of a base depends on the concentration of hydroxide ions it produces when dissolved in water. For example, sodium hydroxide completely breaks down into ions in water, so it is a strong base. However, only a fraction of ammonia breaks down into ions, so it is a weak base."
The overall voltage of the battery is therefore the sum of ________ of the individual cells.,weights,currents,resistances,voltages,"Batteries There are two basic kinds of batteries: disposable, or primary, batteries, in which the electrode reactions are effectively irreversible and which cannot be recharged; andrechargeable, or secondary, batteries, which form an insoluble product that adheres to the electrodes. These batteries can be recharged by applying an electrical potential in the reverse direction. The recharging process temporarily converts a rechargeable battery from a galvanic cell to an electrolytic cell. Batteries are cleverly engineered devices that are based on the same fundamental laws as galvanic cells. The major difference between batteries and the galvanic cells we have previously described is that commercial batteries use solids or pastes rather than solutions as reactants to maximize the electrical output per unit mass. The use of highly concentrated or solid reactants has another beneficial effect: the concentrations of the reactants and the products do not change greatly as the battery is discharged; consequently, the output voltage remains remarkably constant during the discharge process. This behavior is in contrast to that of the Zn/Cu cell, whose output decreases logarithmically as the reaction proceeds (Figure 19.11 ""The Variation of ""). When a battery consists of more than one galvanic cell, the cells are usually connected in series—that is, with the positive (+) terminal of one cell connected to the negative (−) terminal of the next, and so forth. The overall voltage of the battery is therefore the sum of the voltages of the individual cells."
Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand what?,tsunamis,the sun,significant water pressure,extreme water pressure,"Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand extreme water pressure, very cold water, and complete darkness. However, even here, thriving communities of living things can be found. Organisms cluster around hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. The vents release hot water containing chemicals that would be toxic to most other living things. The producers among them are single-celled chemoautotrophs. They make food using energy stored in the chemicals. The tube worms in this chapter's opening photo depend on these chemoautotrophs for food."
Which system are the brain and spinal cord apart of?,limbic system,large nervous system,cerebral cortex,central nervous system,"The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain serves as the control center of the nervous system and the body as a whole. It consists of three major parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. The spinal cord carries nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain."
What are biochemical catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions?,polymers,inhibitor,metabolites,enzymes,"Enzymes are biochemical catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions. Without enzymes, most chemical reactions in living things would occur too slowly to keep organisms alive."

What is the purpose of bright colors on a flower's petals?,to attract a mate,to distract predators,to absorb light,to attract pollinators,"Flowers Flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central stalk. Although they vary greatly in appearance, all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant. A whorl of sepals (collectively called the calyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. For example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical. Petals, collectively the corolla, are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. Sepals and petals together form the perianth. The sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower. As illustrated in Figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. A long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. The ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. The male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium), surround the central carpel. Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-like structure called the anther. The filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains."
Collateral ganglia controls organs in which cavity in the body?,cardiac,cranial,pelvic,abdominal,"To continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within the sympathetic system (Figure 15.3). The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). An example of this type is spinal nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. The fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see Figure 15.3a). The axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). This neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. In some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. With respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the eye. The spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see Figure 15.3b). The cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure 15.3c). Collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. They are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. The three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see Figure 15.2). The word celiac is derived from the Latin word “coelom,” which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the word mesenteric refers to the digestive system."
A bee will sometimes do a dance to tell other bees in the hive where to find what?,honey,enemies,water,food,"There are many other examples of innate behaviors. For example, did you know that honeybees dance? The honeybee pictured below has found a source of food ( Figure below ). When the bee returns to its hive, it will do a dance. This dance is called the waggle dance . The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior."

"Although magma once filled our moon's craters, what is thought to have ended there over a billion years ago?",deserts activity,mineral activity,oceanic activity,volcanic activity,"When you look at the Moon from Earth, you notice dark and light areas. The maria are dark, solid, flat areas of lava (mostly basalt). Maria covers around 16% of the Moon’s surface, mostly on the near side. The maria formed about 3.0 to 4.0 billion years ago, when the Moon was continually bombarded by meteoroids ( Figure below ). Large meteorites broke through the Moon’s newly formed surface. This eventually caused magma to flow out and fill the craters. Scientists estimate volcanic activity on the Moon ended about 1.2 billion years ago."

"Oogenesis, which is gametogenesis in females, begins with what type of ste cells?",uterian,secretion,digestive,ovarian,"Oogenesis Gametogenesis in females is called oogenesis. The process begins with the ovarian stem cells, or oogonia (Figure 27.11). Oogonia are formed during fetal development, and divide via mitosis, much like spermatogonia in the testis. Unlike spermatogonia, however, oogonia form primary oocytes in the fetal ovary prior to birth. These primary oocytes are then arrested in this stage of meiosis I, only to resume it years later, beginning at puberty and continuing until the woman is near menopause (the cessation of a woman’s reproductive functions). The number of primary oocytes present in the ovaries declines from one to two million in an infant, to approximately 400,000 at puberty, to zero by the end of menopause. The initiation of ovulation—the release of an oocyte from the ovary—marks the transition from puberty into reproductive maturity for women. From then on, throughout a woman’s reproductive years, ovulation occurs approximately once every 28 days. Just prior to ovulation, a surge of luteinizing hormone triggers the resumption of meiosis in a primary oocyte. This initiates the transition from primary to secondary oocyte. However, as you can see in Figure 27.11, this cell division does not result in two identical cells. Instead, the cytoplasm is divided unequally, and one daughter cell is much larger than the other. This larger cell, the secondary oocyte, eventually leaves the ovary during ovulation. The smaller cell, called the first polar body, may or may not complete meiosis and produce second polar bodies; in either case, it eventually disintegrates. Therefore, even though oogenesis produces up to four cells, only one survives."

In this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest is obvious. We will see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial—and the choice is not always obvious. Newton’s second law of motion is more than a definition; it is a relationship among acceleration, force, and mass. It can help us make predictions. Each of those physical quantities can be defined independently, so the second law tells us something basic and universal about nature. The next section introduces the third and final law of motion."

"Nephrons, renal tubules and the loop of henle are part of the process of blood filtration by what organs?",liver,bladder,lungs,kidneys,"Kidney Function and Physiology Kidneys filter blood in a three-step process. First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. This entire process is illustrated in Figure 41.7."

The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus a real image on the retina. The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in Figure below . The image reaches the brain as electrical signals that travel through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the signals as shape, color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see is always right-side up. The brain also “tells” us what we are seeing."
What is required to move or change matter from one state to another?,evolution,food,gravity,energy,"Energy provides the ability to move or change matter from one state to another (for example, from solid to liquid). Every living thing needs energy to live and grow. Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day. Cooking your food takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is true for heating or cooling your home. Whether you are turning on a light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy. Billions of people all around the world use energy, so there is a huge demand for resources to provide all of this energy. Why do we need so much energy? The main reason is that almost everything that happens on Earth involves energy."

"Horny ridges on the jaws serve the same function as what, for turtles?",hairs,skin,taste buds,teeth,"Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but in the water is another story. Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous . Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants."

"Which  organs control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine?",ears,lungs,tongue,kidneys,"The kidneys play many vital roles in homeostasis. They filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce a total of about 1.5 liters of urine. The kidneys control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. Erythropoietin, for example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. The kidneys themselves are also regulated by hormones. For example, antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine when the body is low on water."
What unit of measurement is defined to be the number of atoms in 12g of carbon-12?,one ohm,one quark,one joule,one mole,"The relative scale of atomic masses in amu is also a relative scale of masses in grams. We said before that the mole is officially equal to the number of carbon atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. In other words, one carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 amu, and one mole of carbon atoms has a mass of exactly 12 grams. This relationship is true for all substances. If one atom of helium has a mass of 4.00 amu, one mole of helium atoms has a mass of 4.00 g. One molecule of water has a mass of 18.0 amu, so one mole of water molecules has a mass of 18.0 grams. Molar mass is defined as the mass of one mole of representative particles of a substance. It is expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol)."

What are fungi which feed on living cells called?,symbiotic,static,predatory,parasitic,"23.24 Nutrition Fungi are saprophytes. When they find a source of food (e. dead wood, orange peel) , they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where they are used to allow growth and repair. Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate host cells without immediately killing them. However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits: • Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic nutrients) while delivering food to the plant. • The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the plant roots. • The fungal cells help to maintain air and water flow in the soil around the roots. • The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree."

Which two major innovations allowed seed plants to reproduce in the absence of water?,salt and pollen,bee and pollen,root and pollen,seed and pollen,"CHAPTER SUMMARY 26.1 Evolution of Seed Plants Seed plants appeared about one million years ago, during the Carboniferous period. Two major innovations—seed and pollen—allowed seed plants to reproduce in the absence of water. The gametophytes of seed plants shrank, while the sporophytes became prominent structures and the diploid stage became the longest phase of the lifecycle. Gymnosperms became the dominant group during the Triassic. In these, pollen grains and seeds protect against desiccation. The seed, unlike a spore, is a diploid embryo surrounded by storage tissue and protective layers. It is equipped to delay germination until growth conditions are optimal. Angiosperms bear both flowers and fruit. The structures protect the gametes and the embryo during its development. Angiosperms appeared during the Mesozoic era and have become the dominant plant life in terrestrial habitats."

What organs are considered the female gonads?,fallopian tubes,testes,uterus,ovaries,"27.2 | Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the structure and function of the organs of the female reproductive system • List the steps of oogenesis • Describe the hormonal changes that occur during the ovarian and menstrual cycles • Trace the path of an oocyte from ovary to fertilization The female reproductive system functions to produce gametes and reproductive hormones, just like the male reproductive system; however, it also has the additional task of supporting the developing fetus and delivering it to the outside world. Unlike its male counterpart, the female reproductive system is located primarily inside the pelvic cavity (Figure 27.9). Recall that the ovaries are the female gonads. The gamete they produce is called an oocyte. We’ll discuss the production of oocytes in detail shortly. First, let’s look at some of the structures of the female reproductive system."

What is another term for blood clotting?,differentiation,adulation,oxidation,coagulation,"Positive Feedback Loop A positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus, possibly accelerating it. Few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting, or coagulation. As one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved. The direction is maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during childbirth, as illustrated in Figure 33.21. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the uterus. This produces pain sensed by the nervous system. Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside, more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth."

"What phenomenon, which is most important in small populations, occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation?",genetic code,genetic DNA,genetic mutation,genetic drift,"Genetic Drift Another way a population’s allele frequencies can change is genetic drift (Figure 11.7), which is simply the effect of chance. Genetic drift is most important in small populations. Drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. Genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. Alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. If one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—a tenth of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. In a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population’s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. Imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele A and half with allele a (the individuals are haploid). In a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. Choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be A and tails be a. It is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. There might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. Thus, the allele frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. A coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). The frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all A or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. This could take a very long time for a large population. This simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. The effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. Its effect is also greater on an allele with a frequency far from one half. Drift will influence every allele, even those that are being naturally selected."

There are two mechanisms by which the electrons create X-rays. The first method is illustrated in Figure 24.18. An electron is accelerated in an evacuated tube by a high positive voltage. The electron strikes a metal plate (e. , copper) and produces X-rays. Since this is a high-voltage discharge, the electron gains sufficient energy to ionize the atom."

Which property of diamond makes it so hard?,carbon bonds,non-covalent bonds,metal-metal bonds,chemical bonds,"Diamond is the hardest natural material known on Earth. Yet diamond is just pure carbon. What is special about this element that makes diamond so hard? Bonds. Chemical bonds. In a perfect diamond crystal, each C atom makes four connections—bonds—to four other C atoms in a three-dimensional matrix. Four is the greatest number of bonds that is commonly made by atoms, so C atoms maximize their interactions with other atoms. This threedimensional array of connections extends throughout the diamond crystal, making it essentially one large molecule. Breaking a diamond means breaking every bond at once. Also, the bonds are moderately strong. There are stronger interactions known, but the carboncarbon connection is fairly strong itself. Not only does a person have to break many connections at once, but also the bonds are strong connections from the start. There are other substances that have similar bonding arrangements as diamond does. Silicon dioxide and boron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond. How do atoms make compounds? Typically they join together in such a way that they lose their identities as elements and adopt a new identity as a compound. These joins are called chemical bonds. But how do atoms join together? Ultimately, it all comes down to electrons. Before we discuss how electrons interact, we need to introduce a tool to simply illustrate electrons in an atom."

The bony socket that houses the eyeball and associated muscles is called?,acetabulum,cavity,glenoid fossa,orbit,"The Orbit The orbit is the bony socket that houses the eyeball and contains the muscles that move the eyeball or open the upper eyelid. Each orbit is cone-shaped, with a narrow posterior region that widens toward the large anterior opening. To help protect the eye, the bony margins of the anterior opening are thickened and somewhat constricted. The medial walls of the two orbits are parallel to each other but each lateral wall diverges away from the midline at a 45° angle. This divergence provides greater lateral peripheral vision. The walls of each orbit include contributions from seven skull bones (Figure 7.16). The frontal bone forms the roof and the zygomatic bone forms the lateral wall and lateral floor. The medial floor is primarily formed by the maxilla, with a small contribution from the palatine bone. The ethmoid bone and lacrimal bone make up much of the medial wall and the sphenoid bone forms the posterior orbit. At the posterior apex of the orbit is the opening of the optic canal, which allows for passage of the optic nerve from the retina to the brain. Lateral to this is the elongated and irregularly shaped superior orbital fissure, which provides passage for the artery that supplies the eyeball, sensory nerves, and the nerves that supply the muscles involved in eye movements."

The glass hydrometer is filled with air and weighted with lead at the bottom. it floats highest in the densest fluids and has been calibrated and labeled so that you can read this from it?,density,volume,mass,specific gravity,"CHAPTER SUMMARY 12.1 Mendel’s Experiments and the Laws of Probability Working with garden pea plants, Mendel found that crosses between parents that differed by one trait produced F1 offspring that all expressed the traits of one parent. Observable traits are referred to as dominant, and non-expressed traits are described as recessive. When the offspring in Mendel’s experiment were self-crossed, the F2 offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original P0 parent. Reciprocal crosses generated identical F1 and F2 offspring ratios. By examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events. Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different crosses. To find the probability of two or more independent events occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the probabilities of the individual events. The use of the word “and” suggests the appropriate application of the product rule. To find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual probabilities together. The use of the word “or” suggests the appropriate application of the sum rule."

"When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in what?",weight,surface,height,diameter,"The cardiovascular system also plays a role in maintaining body temperature. It helps to keep you warm by moving warm blood around your body. Your blood vessels also control your body temperature to keep you from getting too hot or too cold. When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. Increasing the diameter of the blood vessels increases the amount of blood and heat that moves near the skin's surface. The heat is then released from the skin. This helps you cool down. What do you think your blood vessels do when your body temperature is decreasing?."
Ingestion and propulsion are the first two steps in which process that describes how humans process and consume food?,respiration,absorption,regeneration,digestion,"Digestive Processes The processes of digestion include six activities: ingestion, propulsion, mechanical or physical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and defecation. The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food plus some lipid digestion via lingual lipase. Chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced. Food leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it into the esophagus. This act of swallowing, the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example of propulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the digestive tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to propel food along (Figure 23.5). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head."

What type of change is undergone when the physical properties of a substance are changed?,atmospheric,thermal,genetic,physical,"Any time the physical properties of a substance are changed, we can say the substance has undergone a physical change . All substances undergo physical changes where there is a change in the form of the substance but not in its chemical composition. For instance, the grinding of granular sugar into powdered sugar is a physical change. Similarly, dissolving sugar in water is a physical change. We can also use physical changes to separate mixtures into their components. There are a variety of methods used, and the best procedure depends largely on the nature of the mixture. Depending on the states of matter involved, the relative sizes of the mixtures components, and whether the mixture is homogeneous or heterogeneous will determine the necessary separation technique."

Where on a jellyfish is the mouth opening located?,top,left side,right side,underside,"In the jellyfish, a mouth opening is present on the underside of the animal, surrounded by tentacles bearing nematocysts. Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. The mouth leads to the gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli. In some species, the digestive system may be further branched into radial canals. Like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two functions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion; thus, more cells are in direct contact with the nutrients in the gastrovascular cavity. In scyphozoans, nerve cells are scattered all over the body. Neurons may even be present in clusters called rhopalia. These animals possess a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water. Scyphozoans are dioecious animals, that is, the sexes are separate. The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth. Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma. These forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form. The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of these animals can be described as polymorphic, because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle."
Calcium ion is an example of what kind of messenger?,first,third,fourth,second,"Second Messengers Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins. Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, Ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca 2+ leads to muscle contractions. Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells."

What is the process by which water moves through semi-permeable membranes from one part of the body to another?,mitosis,diffusion,electrolysis,osmosis,"26.1 | Body Fluids and Fluid Compartments By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the importance of water in the body • Contrast the composition of the intracellular fluid with that of the extracellular fluid • Explain the importance of protein channels in the movement of solutes • Identify the causes and symptoms of edema The chemical reactions of life take place in aqueous solutions. The dissolved substances in a solution are called solutes. In the human body, solutes vary in different parts of the body, but may include proteins—including those that transport lipids, carbohydrates, and, very importantly, electrolytes. Often in medicine, a mineral dissociated from a salt that carries an electrical charge (an ion) is called and electrolyte. For instance, sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-) are often referred to as electrolytes. In the body, water moves through semi-permeable membranes of cells and from one compartment of the body to another by a process called osmosis. Osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration, along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. As a result, water will move into and out of cells and tissues, depending on the relative concentrations of the water and solutes found there. An appropriate balance of solutes inside and outside of cells must be maintained to ensure normal function."

What cells are the basis of nervous tissue?,osteoclasts,erythrocytes,lipocytes,neurons,"Neurons Neurons are the cells considered to be the basis of nervous tissue. They are responsible for the electrical signals that communicate information about sensations, and that produce movements in response to those stimuli, along with inducing thought processes within the brain. An important part of the function of neurons is in their structure, or shape. The threedimensional shape of these cells makes the immense numbers of connections within the nervous system possible."
"Pure carbon can exist in different forms, depending on how its atoms are arranged. the forms include diamond, graphite, and what else?",ligands,calcites,lead,fullerenes,"Pure carbon can exist in different forms, depending on how its atoms are arranged. The forms include diamond, graphite, and fullerenes. All three forms exist as crystals, but they have different structures. Their different structures, in turn, give them different properties.

"Which cavity, filled with lubricating serous fluid, lies between the epicardium and the pericardium?",thoracic cavity,cranial cavity,oral cavity,pericardial cavity,"and is part of the heart wall. The pericardial cavity, filled with lubricating serous fluid, lies between the epicardium and the pericardium. In most organs within the body, visceral serous membranes such as the epicardium are microscopic. However, in the case of the heart, it is not a microscopic layer but rather a macroscopic layer, consisting of a simple squamous epithelium called a mesothelium, reinforced with loose, irregular, or areolar connective tissue that attaches to the pericardium. This mesothelium secretes the lubricating serous fluid that fills the pericardial cavity and reduces friction as the heart contracts. Figure 19.5 illustrates the pericardial membrane and the layers of the heart."

"In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called what?",metabolic circulation,systemic circulation,sensory circulation,pulmonary circulation,"In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. As shown in Figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in Figure 40.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure 40.4d. The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution."

"In the microbiology lab, what technique refers to the procedures that are carried out under sterile conditions?",ionization,personal hygiene,experimental control,aseptic,"In the microbiology lab, aseptic technique refers to the procedures that are carried out under sterile conditions. Scientists who study microbes are called microbiologists. Microbiologists must carry out their lab work using the aseptic technique to prevent microbial contamination of themselves, contamination of the environment they are working in, including work surfaces or equipment, and contamination of the sample they are working on. Bacteria live on just about every surface on Earth, so if a scientist wants to grow a particular type of bacterium in the lab, he or she needs to be able to sterilize their equipment to prevent contamination by other bacteria or microorganisms. The aseptic technique is also used in medicine, where it is important to keep the human body free of contamination."
"Connecting a magnesium rod to an underground steel pipeline protects the pipeline from corrosion. because magnesium (e° = −2.37 v) is much more easily oxidized than iron (e° = −0.45 v), the mg rod acts as the anode in a what?",voltaic cell,anode cell,stimulation cell,galvanic cell,"Connecting a magnesium rod to an underground steel pipeline protects the pipeline from corrosion. Because magnesium (E° = −2.37 V) is much more easily oxidized than iron (E° = −0.45 V), the Mg rod acts as the anode in a galvanic cell. The pipeline is therefore forced to act as the cathode at which oxygen is reduced. The soil between the anode and the cathode acts as a salt bridge that completes the electrical circuit and maintains electrical neutrality. As Mg(s) is oxidized to Mg2+ at the anode, anions in the soil, such as nitrate, diffuse toward the anode to neutralize the positive charge. Simultaneously, cations in the soil, such as H+ or NH4+, diffuse toward the cathode, where they replenish the protons that are consumed as oxygen is reduced. A similar strategy uses many miles of somewhat less reactive zinc wire to protect the Alaska oil pipeline."
"Matrix is the term for the fluid-filled interior of what structure, where most of the cell’s atp is made?",enzyme,nucleus,Golgi apparatus,mitochondria,"As the Figure below (a) and (b) shows, a mitochondrion has two phospholipids membranes. The smooth outer membrane separates the mitochondrion from the cytosol. The inner membrane has many folds, called cristae . These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area for integral proteins. Many proteins involved in cellular respiration are embedded in this inner membrane. The greater surface area allows more proteins to be located there, resulting in more cellular respiration reactions, and more ATP synthesis. ATP is produced by the enzyme ATP synthase, which is a membrane protein of the mitochondria inner membrane. The fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrian, called matrix , is where most of the cell’s ATP is made."
"Chitin, also found in the exoskeleton of insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. the cell wall protects the cell from what?",starvation and predators,fermentation and predators,entrainment and predators,desiccation and predators,"Like plant cells, fungal cells are surrounded by a thick cell wall; however, the rigid layers contain the complex polysaccharides chitin and glucan and not cellulose that is used by plants. Chitin, also found in the exoskeleton of insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. The cell wall protects the cell from desiccation and predators. Fungi have plasma membranes similar to other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol, a steroid molecule that functions like the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. Flagella are produced only by the gametes in the primitive division Chytridiomycota. Growth and Reproduction The vegetative body of a fungus is called a thallus and can be unicellular or multicellular. Some fungi are dimorphic because they can go from being unicellular to multicellular depending on environmental conditions. Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) and Candida species (the agents of thrush, a common fungal infection) are examples of unicellular fungi. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. They display two distinct morphological stages: vegetative and reproductive. The vegetative stage is characterized by a tangle of slender thread-like structures called hyphae (singular, hypha), whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous. A mass of hyphae is called a mycelium (Figure 13.22). It can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even in or on living tissue. Although individual hypha must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large with some species truly being “the fungus humongous. ” The giant Armillaria ostoyae (honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on Earth, spreading across over 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old."
What is the term for air moving over earth’s surface?,tidal,humidity,spin cycle,wind,"Wind is only air moving over Earth’s surface, but it can cause a lot of erosion. Look at Figure below . It will give you an idea of just how much erosion wind can cause. The dust storm in the photo occurred in Arizona. All that dust in the air was picked up and carried by the wind. The wind may carry the dust for hundreds of kilometers before depositing it."
Each of what paired organs is enclosed within a cavity surrounded by the pleura?,heart,bones,ovaries,lungs,"Pleura of the Lungs Each lung is enclosed within a cavity that is surrounded by the pleura. The pleura (plural = pleurae) is a serous membrane that surrounds the lung. The right and left pleurae, which enclose the right and left lungs, respectively, are separated by the mediastinum. The pleurae consist of two layers. The visceral pleura is the layer that is superficial to the lungs, and extends into and lines the lung fissures (Figure 22.14). In contrast, the parietal pleura is the outer layer that connects to the thoracic wall, the mediastinum, and the diaphragm. The visceral and parietal pleurae connect to each other at the hilum. The pleural cavity is the space between the visceral and parietal layers."
What are the best-known extinct vertebrates?,trilobites,snakes,trees,dinosaurs,"Introduction Vertebrates are among the most recognizable organisms of the animal kingdom. More than 62,000 vertebrate species have been identified. The vertebrate species now living represent only a small portion of the vertebrates that have existed. The best-known extinct vertebrates are the dinosaurs, a unique group of reptiles, which reached sizes not seen before or after in terrestrial animals. They were the dominant terrestrial animals for 150 million years, until they died out in a mass extinction near the end of the Cretaceous period. Although it is not known with certainty what caused their extinction, a great deal is known about the anatomy of the dinosaurs, given the preservation of skeletal elements in the fossil record. Currently, a number of vertebrate species face extinction primarily due to habitat loss and pollution. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, more than 6,000 vertebrate species are classified as threatened. Amphibians and mammals are the classes with the greatest percentage of threatened species, with 29 percent of all amphibians and 21 percent of all mammals classified as threatened. Attempts are being made around the world to prevent the extinction of threatened species. For example, the Biodiversity Action Plan is an international program, ratified by 188 countries, which is designed to protect species and habitats."

How does increasing the temperature of reactants affect the rate of their reaction?,it decreases it,it patterns it,it is unchanged,it increases it,"When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage."
What type of eclipse happens when a full moon moves through earth's shadow?,planetary,cycle,solar,lunar,"Sometimes a full moon moves through Earth's shadow. This is a lunar eclipse ( Figure below ). During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon travels completely in Earth’s umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earth’s umbra. When the Moon passes through Earth’s penumbra, it is a penumbral eclipse. Since Earth’s shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts for hours. Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar eclipse."
Dynamite is an example of what type of potential energy?,thermal,carbon,mineral,chemical,"Dynamite is another example of chemical potential energy. The major component of dynamite is nitroglycerin, a very unstable material.

"In astronomy, what are so dense that not even light can escape their gravity?",red holes,black rods,dwarf stars,black holes,"If the core remaining after a supernova is more than about 5 times the mass of the Sun, the core collapses to become a black hole . Black holes are so dense that not even light can escape their gravity. For that reason, we can't see black holes. How can we know something exists if radiation can't escape it? We know a black hole is there by the effect that it has on objects around it. Also, some radiation leaks out around its edges. A black hole isn't a hole at all. It is the tremendously dense core of a supermassive star."

A solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material forms what?,compress,impoundment,compass,electromagnet,"Solenoids are the basis of electromagnets. An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material (see Figure below ). The electromagnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. The combined magnetic force of the magnetized iron bar and the wire coil makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. Some of them are strong enough to lift a train. The maglev train described earlier, in the lesson ""Electricity and Magnetism,"" contains permanent magnets. Strong electromagnets in the track repel the train magnets, causing the train to levitate above the track."

"Unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar are the four basic types of what?",electrons,ions,protons,neurons,"While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar. Figure 35.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types. Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord."

"What process, which is analogous to mitosis, is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes and chromatids into daughter cells?",digestion,apoptosis,inhibition,meiosis,"CHAPTER SUMMARY 11.1 The Process of Meiosis Sexual reproduction requires that diploid organisms produce haploid cells that can fuse during fertilization to form diploid offspring. As with mitosis, DNA replication occurs prior to meiosis during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Meiosis is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes and chromatids into daughter cells. During the interphases of meiosis, each chromosome is duplicated. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The first separates homologs, and the second—like mitosis—separates chromatids into individual chromosomes. During meiosis, variation in the daughter."

"When the earth is between the moon and the sun, what type of moon shows?",crescent moon,waning moon,half moon,a full moon,"A full moon occurs when the whole side facing Earth is lit. This happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun. About one week later, the Moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the Moon’s lit surface is visible from Earth, so it appears as a half circle. When the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun, the side facing Earth is completely dark. This is called the new moon phase. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the Earth and hits the Moon. Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the crescent moon phase, the Moon is less than half lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the gibbous moon phase, the Moon is more than half lit. It is not full. The Moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days."

While the moon is only 406,697 km from earth at its maximum distance, the sun is much further away (150 million km). Proxima Centauri, the star nearest the earth, is 39, 900, 000, 000, 000 km away and we have just started on long distances. On the other end of the scale, some biologists deal with very small numbers: a typical fungus could be as small as 30 μmeters (0.000030 meters) in length and a virus might only be 0.03 μmeters (0.00000003 meters) long."
What are the majority of solution properties dependent upon?,acid state of solute,similar state of solute,gas state of solute,chemical state of solute,"The properties of a solution are different from those of either the pure solute(s) or solvent. Many solution properties are dependent upon the chemical identity of the solute. Compared to pure water, a solution of hydrogen chloride is more acidic, a solution of ammonia is more basic, a solution of sodium chloride is more dense, and a solution of sucrose is more viscous. There are a few solution properties, however, that depend only upon the total concentration of solute species, regardless of their identities. These colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. This small set of properties is of central importance to many natural phenomena and technological applications, as will be described in this module."

"If the dna from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately how long?",one meter,three meters,four meters,two meters,"Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. At the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 10.4). The DNA-histone complex is called chromatin. The beadlike, histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA. A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. In the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in Figure 10.3)."

What particles ancient greeks propose that matter consists of ?,ether,ions,molecules,atoms,"Summary 2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. Rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 × 10−24 g. Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number."
Repolarization occurs when the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting what?,tension,charge,resistance,voltage,"As the membrane potential reaches +30 mV, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. These channels are specific for the potassium ion. A concentration gradient acts on K+, as well. As K+ starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. This is called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting membrane potential. Repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the K+ channels are open. Those K+ channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for this short overshoot. What has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in Figure 12.23. It is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. The change in the membrane voltage from -70 mV at rest to +30 mV at the end of depolarization is a 100-mV change. That can also be written as a 0.1-V change. To put that value in perspective, think about a battery. An AA battery that you might find in a television remote has a voltage of 1.5 V, or a 9-V battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 V. The change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. In fact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery. A charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions. A battery in your remote has stored a charge that is “released” when you push a button."

"Which organelles, made of protein and ribosomal rna, build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm?",chromosomes,chloroplasts,dna,ribosomes,"The nucleus of many cells also contains an organelle called a nucleolus , shown in Figure below . The nucleolus is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. Ribosomes are organelles made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm. The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding the genetic messages within another type of RNA, called mRNA for messenger RNA, into amino acids. After being made in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they direct protein synthesis."

What is the dinosaur genus that's closest to modern birds?,Rapter,sauropods,diplodocus,deinonychus,"Deinonychus is the genus name of an extinct dinosaur that is considered to be one of the closest non-bird relatives of modern birds. It lived about 110 million years ago in what is now North America. Deinonychus was a predatory carnivore with many bird-like features. For example, it had feathers and wings. It also had strong legs with clawed feet, similar to modern raptors. Its respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems were similar to those of birds as well. The location of fossilized eggs near Deinonychus fossils suggests that it may have brooded its eggs. This would mean that it was endothermic. (Can you explain why?) On the other hand, Deinonychus retained a number of reptile-like traits, such as jaws with teeth and hands with claws at the tips of its wings."
In what type of organisms are daughter cells individuals?,hematopoietic organisms,multicellular organisms,macroscopic organisms,unicellular organisms,"6.4 | Prokaryotic Cell Division By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the process of binary fission in prokaryotes • Explain how FtsZ and tubulin proteins are examples of homology Prokaryotes such as bacteria propagate by binary fission. For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals. To achieve the outcome of identical daughter cells, some steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life. In bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell division is simplified. Mitosis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus or multiple chromosomes. This type of cell division is called binary fission."
"What group was long considered part of the plant kingdom because of obvious similarities; both are immobile, have cell walls, and grow in soil?",bacteria,mosses,coral,fungi,"For a long time, scientists considered fungi to be members of the plant kingdom because they have obvious similarities with plants. Both fungi and plants are immobile, have cell walls, and grow in soil. Some fungi, such as lichens, even look like plants (see Figure below )."
What type of waves transmit the energy of an earthquake?,volcanic waves,tectonic waves,sonic waves,seismic waves,"An earthquake is sudden ground movement. This movement is caused by the sudden release of the energy stored in rocks. An earthquake happens when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks break. An earthquake’s energy is transmitted by seismic waves. Each year, there are more than 150,000 earthquakes strong enough to be felt by people. An amazing 900,000 are recorded by seismometers."
"In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at what?",default,rest,scale,resonance,"It is interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in Figure 16.27 depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. The message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. Little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. Conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car’s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. Heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies. These features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. When you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. The more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). A child on a swing is driven by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. Speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car’s suspension system is not immune to resonance. In spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. On gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the “wrong” speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. Figure 16.28 shows a photograph of a famous example (the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. The Millennium Bridge in London was closed for a short period of time for the same reason while inspections were carried out. In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. The diaphragm and chest wall drive the oscillations of the chest cavity which result in the lungs inflating and deflating. The system is critically damped and the muscular diaphragm oscillates at the resonant value for the system, making it highly efficient."
How do prokaryotic cells divide?,multiple fission,Fusion,function fission,binary fission,Prokaryotic cells grow to a certain size. Then they divide by binary fission. This is a type of asexual reproduction. It produces genetically identical offspring. Genetic transfer increases genetic variation in prokaryotes.
What is the term for a series of biochemical reactions by which an organism converts a given reactant to a specific end product?,hydrogen pathway,internal pathway,direct pathway,metabolic pathway,"A metabolic pathway is a series of biochemical reactions by which an organism converts a given reactant to a specific end product. As you will learn in Section 20.5 ""Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism"" through Section 20.7 ""Stage II of Protein Catabolism"", there are specific metabolic pathways—which are different for carbohydrates, triglycerides, and proteins—that break down the products of stage I of catabolism (monosaccharides, fatty acids, and amino acids) to produce a common end product, acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in stage II of catabolism. Acetyl-CoA is shown in Figure 20.10 ""The Structure of Acetyl-Coenzyme A (AcetylCoA)"". The acetyl unit, derived (as we will see) from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, is attached to coenzyme A, making the acetyl unit more reactive. Acetyl-CoA is used in a myriad of biochemical pathways. For example, it may be used as the starting material for the biosynthesis of lipids (such as triglycerides, phospholipids, or cholesterol and other steroids). Most importantly for energy generation, it may enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to produce energy, if energy is needed and oxygen is available. The various fates or uses of acetyl-CoA are summarized in Figure 20.11 ""Cell Chemistry"". Figure 20.10 The Structure of Acetyl-Coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA)."
"Exemplified by sea stars and sand dollars, echinoderms have a calcareous structure developed by pigment cells and made of ossicles, which is called what?",thorax,hydrostatic skeleton,exoskeleton,endoskeleton,"Phylum Echinodermata Echinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin (from the Greek “echinos” meaning “spiny” and “dermos” meaning “skin”), and this phylum is a collection of about 7,000 described living species. Echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms. Sea stars (Figure 28.44), sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms. To date, no freshwater or terrestrial echinoderms are known. Morphology and Anatomy Adult echinoderms exhibit pentaradial symmetry and have a calcareous endoskeleton made of ossicles, although the early larval stages of all echinoderms have bilateral symmetry. The endoskeleton is developed by epidermal cells and may possess pigment cells, giving vivid colors to these animals, as well as cells laden with toxins. Gonads are present in each arm. In echinoderms like sea stars, every arm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral side. These tube feet help in attachment to the substratum. These animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system. An interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate, even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost."
What phase does the nuclear envelope begin to break down?,interphase,nitrogenase i,pasiphaë i,prophase i,"Prophase I: The nuclear envelope begins to break down, and the chromosomes condense. Centrioles start moving to opposite poles of the cell, and a spindle begins to form. Importantly, homologous chromosomes pair up, which is unique to prophase I. In prophase of mitosis and meiosis II, homologous chromosomes do not form pairs in this way. During prophase I, crossing-over occurs (see below)."

What is another name for anther pollen sacs?,Gametangia,ganglia,Megasporangia,microsporangia,
What is released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse?,semen,urine,blood,vaginal secretions,"The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring. It is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells to protect the underlying tissue. Sexual Response during Intercourse The sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological. Both sexes experience sexual arousal through psychological and physical stimulation. There are four phases of the sexual response. During phase one, called excitement, vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women. The nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis engorge with blood and become enlarged. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse. During the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase. During phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes. In the male, the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis. In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each. During phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. Men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours."

What does a continuous string of earthquakes indicate about a volcano?,it is heating up,extinction is close,it is cooling down,eruption is close,"Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake."

"Besides the size of their crystals, how are igneous rocks grouped?",by color,by shapes,impurities they contain,minerals they contain,"Igneous rocks are grouped by the size of their crystals and the minerals they contain. The minerals in igneous rocks are grouped into families. Some contain mostly lighter colored minerals, some have a combination of light and dark minerals, and some have mostly darker minerals. The combination of minerals is determined by the composition of the magma. Magmas that produce lighter colored minerals are higher in silica. These create rocks such as granite and rhyolite. Darker colored minerals are found in rocks such as gabbro and basalt."
Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a what?,tissue,gravity,gases,fluid,"14.4 Heat Transfer Methods Equally as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which this occurs. Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may occur rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of a picnic ice chest. We can control rates of heat transfer by choosing materials (such as thick wool clothing for the winter), controlling air movement (such as the use of weather stripping around doors), or by choice of color (such as a white roof to reflect summer sunlight). So many processes involve heat transfer, so that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. Yet every process involving heat transfer takes place by only three methods: 1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale—we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero. ) Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of the Earth by the Sun. A less obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body."
Hypersection by an endocrine gland is often caused by what?,viruses,calcium,inflammation,tumor,"Hypersecretion by an endocrine gland is often caused by a tumor. For example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause hypersecretion of growth hormone. If this occurs in childhood, it results in very long arms and legs and abnormally tall stature by adulthood. The condition is commonly known as gigantism (see Figure below ). See Giants - Part 1 - Pituitary Gigantism and Acromegaly at http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=Ebhf1qKVA9A for information about pituitary giants."
What gland secretes growth hormones?,thyroid,pineal,adrenal,pituitary,"Hormones That Influence Osteoblasts and/or Maintain the Matrix Several hormones are necessary for controlling bone growth and maintaining the bone matrix. The pituitary gland secretes growth hormone (GH), which, as its name implies, controls bone growth in several ways. It triggers chondrocyte proliferation in epiphyseal plates, resulting in the increasing length of long bones. GH also increases calcium retention, which enhances mineralization, and stimulates osteoblastic activity, which improves bone density. GH is not alone in stimulating bone growth and maintaining osseous tissue. Thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland promotes osteoblastic activity and the synthesis of bone matrix. During puberty, the sex hormones (estrogen in girls, testosterone in boys) also come into play. They too promote osteoblastic activity and production of bone matrix, and in addition, are responsible for the growth spurt that often occurs during adolescence. They also promote the conversion of the epiphyseal plate to the epiphyseal line (i. , cartilage to its bony remnant), thus bringing an end to the longitudinal growth of bones. Additionally, calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is produced by the kidneys and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the digestive tract."
We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of these?,electron bonds,isotopes,negative charges,actual charges,"Calculating Formal Charge The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure. Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows: formal charge = # valence shell electrons (free atom) − # lone pair electrons − 1 # bonding electrons 2 We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion. We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges."

The amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for which clade?,avian,trichina,xerophyte,amniota,"What is the largest clade in this diagram? Shared Characteristics Organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. Scientists use the phrase “descent with modification” because even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. This pattern repeats over and over as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life: 1. A change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group. Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait. New variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits. With new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat). If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait. The vertebrate in Figure 20.10 is a shared ancestral character. Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure. Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree. The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative. The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used. Returning to Figure 20.10, note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some organisms in this group. These terms help scientists distinguish between clades in the building of phylogenetic trees."
Lyme disease is caused by what kind of organim?,algae,Virus,bacterium,bacteria,"Humans have literally walked into some new bacterial diseases. When people come into contact with wild populations, they may become part of natural cycles of disease transmission. Consider Lyme disease. It’s caused by bacteria that normally infect small, wild mammals, such as mice. A tick bites a mouse and picks up the bacteria. The tick may then bite a human who invades the natural habitat. Through the bite, the bacteria are transmitted to the human host."

The development of the respiratory system in the fetus begins at about?,4 days,2 weeks,4 months,4 weeks,"22.7 Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System The development of the respiratory system in the fetus begins at about 4 weeks and continues into childhood. Ectodermal tissue in the anterior portion of the head region invaginates posteriorly, forming olfactory pits, which ultimately fuse with endodermal tissue of the early pharynx. At about this same time, an protrusion of endodermal tissue extends anteriorly from the foregut, producing a lung bud, which continues to elongate until it forms the laryngotracheal bud. The proximal portion of this structure will mature into the trachea, whereas the bulbous end will branch to form two bronchial buds. These buds then branch repeatedly, so that at about week 16, all major airway structures are present. Development progresses after week 16 as respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive vascularization occurs. Alveolar type I cells also begin to take shape. Type II pulmonary cells develop and begin to produce small amounts of surfactant. As the fetus grows, the respiratory system continues to expand as more alveoli develop and more surfactant is produced. Beginning at about week 36 and lasting into childhood, alveolar precursors mature to become fully functional alveoli. At birth, compression of the thoracic cavity forces much of the fluid in the lungs to be expelled. The first inhalation inflates the lungs. Fetal breathing movements begin around week 20 or 21, and occur when contractions of the respiratory muscles cause the fetus."
What are plants that grow on other plants called?,bryophytes,fungi,parasites,epiphytes,"Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants. They obtain moisture from the air instead of the soil. Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in rainforests. Host trees provide support for the plants. They allow epiphytes to get air and sunlight high above the forest floor. This lets the plants get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough light for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores. In addition, it may increase the chances of pollination by wind."

"A thermite reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous, and because it is associated with a significant release of heat, it is regarded as what?",endothermic,biochemical,endotropic,exothermic,"Thermodynamic spontaneity. The highly exothermic and dramatic thermite reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous. Reactants of aluminum and a metal oxide, usually iron, which are stable at room temperature, are ignited either in the presence of heat or by the reaction of potassium permanganate and glycerin. The resulting products are aluminum oxide, free and molten elemental metal, and a great deal of heat, which makes this an excellent method for on-site welding. Because this reaction has its own oxygen supply, it can be used for underwater welding as well."
What do nectar-feeding bats do to flowers?,consume,defecate,illuminate,pollinate,"Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic relationships. For example, bats have established mutually beneficial relationships with plants. Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat from each flower, and, in return, they pollinate the flowers. That means they transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing the plant to reproduce. Non-flying mammalian pollinators include marsupials, primates, and rodents. In most cases, these animals visit flowers to eat their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies. When the animal visits another flower to eat the nectar, the pollen is transferred to that flower."

The number of what subatomic particles determines an element’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another?,electrons,neutrons,quarks,protons,"Atomic Number and Mass Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an element’s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element’s mass number, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. Since an element’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic mass, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons)."

A dilute solution is one that has a relatively small amount of what?,pH level,density,saturated fat,dissolved solute,"There are cultures that have no numbers above three. Anything greater than that is simply referred to as “much” or “many”. We recognize how limited this form of calculation is, but we do some of the same thing. There are several ways to express the amount of solute in a solution in a quantitative manner. The concentration of a solution is a measure of the amount of solute that has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent or solution. A concentrated solution is one that has a relatively large amount of dissolved solute. A dilute solution is one that has a relatively small amount of dissolved solute. However, those terms are vague and we need to be able to express concentration with numbers."

"If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, what is released in the atmosphere?",electricity,oxygen,hydrogen,heat,"Another important example of the combination of phase change and convection occurs when water evaporates from the oceans. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. Water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. This energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. More condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. Such a mechanism is called positive feedback, since the process reinforces and accelerates itself. These systems sometimes produce violent storms, with lightning and hail, and constitute the mechanism driving hurricanes."

Induction cooktops have high efficiencies and good response times but the base of the pot needs to be ferromagnetic, iron or steel for induction to work."
How many types of molecular orbitals can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms?,ten,three,six,two,"There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated in Figure 8.29. The in-phase combination produces a lower energy σs molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s"") in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher energy molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s-star"") molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in a σs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the σ*s orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill higher-energy atomic orbitals."

Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands ( Figure below )."
The building blocks of proteins are called what?,protein acids,boric acids,mutation acids,amino acids,"2.3 Biological Molecules Living things are carbon-based because carbon plays such a prominent role in the chemistry of living things. The four covalent bonding positions of the carbon atom can give rise to a wide diversity of compounds with many functions, accounting for the importance of carbon in living things. Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell, provide structural support to many organisms, and can be found on the surface of the cell as receptors or for cell recognition. Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, depending on the number of monomers in the molecule. Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and oils are a stored form of energy and can include triglycerides. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty acids and glycerol. Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones. The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature, pH, or chemical exposure may lead to protein denaturation and a loss of function."

"In photosynthesis, what process involving carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata?",transpiration,osmosis,fertilization,gas exchange,"Although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved. In plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. For plants, chloroplastcontaining cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. As shown in Figure 8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “bed” (not to be confused with stoma or “mouth,” an opening on the leaf epidermis)."
Which molecules are made of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms?,particles,fats,proteins,hydrocarbons,Hydrocarbons are molecules made of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms.
Atoms of different elements have different numbers of what?,nucleus,electrons,neutrons,protons,"All protons are identical. For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other elements, or pure substances. However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements. For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons. The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are neutral in charge. The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2.

Acidic hydrogen atoms are those which will be transferred to what?,another atom,water,a cup,a base,"Acids can further be categorized based on how many acidic hydrogen atoms they contain. Acidic hydrogen atoms are those which will be transferred to a base. A monoprotic acid has only one acidic hydrogen that would be transferred to a strong base, whereas a polyprotic acid has two or more. Common monoprotic acids include HCl, HBr, and HNO 3 . A common diprotic acid is sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ) provides an example of a triprotic acid. In each case, all hydrogens are available to participate in acid-base reactions. However, that is not the case for all acidic molecules. For example, in acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), only the hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom is acidic. The other three hydrogens are covalently bonded to carbon and cannot be removed by any of the bases that we will consider in this chapter."

"According to the special theory of relativity, no physical object can equal or exceed the speed of what?",weight,air,energy,light,"A result of the special theory of relativity is that no physical object can equal or exceed the speed of light. From the equation for relativistic mass, it can be seen that as the object is accelerated faster and faster, its mass becomes greater and greater. The greater mass would require an even greater force to accelerate it. If the velocity of the mass ever reached the speed of light, the denominator of the equation would become zero and the mass would become infinite. The energy required to accelerate an infinite mass would also be infinite. The fact that light itself travels at the speed , implies that light has a zero rest mass. Of course, light is never at rest."

What do you call the basic units of the structure and function of living things?,proteins,molecules,enzymes,cells,"If you look at living matter with a microscope—even a simple light microscope—you will see that it consists of cells. Cells are the basic units of the structure and function of living things. They are the smallest units that can carry out the processes of life. All organisms are made up of one or more cells, and all cells have many of the same structures and carry out the same basic life processes. Knowing the structures of cells and the processes they carry out is necessary to understanding life itself."
What is the conversion of a solid to a gas called?,education,speciation,amplification,sublimation,"(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout."
Which form of dialysis has a patient’s blood pass through a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine?,arterial dialysis,peritoneal dialysis,limbic dialysis,hemodialysis,"In one form of dialysis, called hemodialysis, a patient’s blood is passed though a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine (also called adialysis machine). A section of tubing composed of a semipermeable membrane is immersed in a solution of sterile water, glucose, amino acids, and certain electrolytes. The osmotic pressure of the blood forces waste molecules and excess water through the membrane into the sterile solution. Red and white blood cells are too large to pass through the membrane, so they remain in the blood. After being cleansed in this way, the blood is returned to the body. Dialysis is a continuous process, as the osmosis of waste materials and excess water takes time. Typically, 5–10 lb of waste-containing fluid is removed in each dialysis session, which can last 2–8 hours and must be performed several times a week. Although some patients have been on dialysis for 30 or more years, dialysis is always a temporary solution because waste materials are constantly building up in the bloodstream. A more permanent solution is a kidney transplant. Cell walls are semipermeable membranes, so the osmotic pressures of the body’s fluids have important biological consequences. If solutions of different osmolarity exist on either side of the cells, solvent (water) may pass into or out of the cells, sometimes with disastrous results. Consider what happens if red blood cells are placed in a hypotonic solution, meaning a solution of lower osmolarity than the liquid inside the cells. The cells swell up as water enters them, disrupting cellular activity and eventually causing the cells to burst. This process is called hemolysis. If red blood cells are placed in ahypertonic solution, meaning one having a higher osmolarity than exists inside the cells, water leaves the cells to dilute the external solution, and the red blood cells shrivel and die. This process is called crenation. Only if red blood cells are placed inisotonic solutions that have the same osmolarity as exists inside the cells are they unaffected by negative effects of osmotic pressure. Glucose solutions of about 0.31 M, or sodium chloride solutions of about 0.16 M, are isotonic with blood plasma."
What are the only type of elements capable of changing into different elements?,adjacent elements,noble gases,metalloids,radioactive elements,"Some elements naturally change into different elements. To understand how this happens, first recall what an element is. An element is a unique substance, with a unique number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms. No two elements have the same number of protons. For example, carbon atoms always have six protons. If an atom has a different number of protons, it isn’t carbon. For an element to change into a different element, then, it must change the number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms. This happens only in radioactive elements."
What does the inside of all cells also contain?,chromosomes,chloroplasm,protein,cytosol,"The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called cytosol . Cytosol is composed of water and other molecules, including enzymes , which are proteins that speed up the cell’s chemical reactions. Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold. The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell. The cytoplasm does not include the nucleus. As a prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm."
"What anatomical structures insulate, protect and provide sensory input?",salivary glands,teeth,fingernails,hair,"Hair helps to insulate and protect the body. Head hair is especially important in preventing heat loss from the body. Eyelashes and eyebrows protect the eyes from water, dirt, and other irritants. Hairs in the nose trap dust particles and microorganisms in the air and prevent them from reaching the lungs. Hair also provides sensory input when objects brush against it or it sways in moving air."
"Known for its beautiful rings, what is the second largest planet in the solar system?",Venus,Mars,jupiter,saturn,"Saturn, shown in Figure below , is famous for its beautiful rings. Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system. Saturn’s mass is about 95 times Earth's mass. The gas giant is 755 times Earth’s volume. Despite its large size, Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar system. Saturn is actually less dense than water. This means that if there were a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float! In Roman mythology, Saturn was the father of Jupiter. Saturn orbits the Sun once about every 30 Earth years."
What kind of waves are used in radar guns?,radio waves,x-rays,WIFI,microwaves,Electromagnetic waves carry energy through matter or space as vibrating electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. The complete range is called the electromagnetic spectrum. The Figure below shows all the waves of the spectrum. The waves used in radar guns are microwaves.
On what lobe of the liver is the gallbladder near?,internal lobe,left lobe,central lobe,right lobe,"The Gallbladder The gallbladder is 8–10 cm (~3–4 in) long and is nested in a shallow area on the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver. This muscular sac stores, concentrates, and, when stimulated, propels the bile into the duodenum via the common bile duct. It is divided into three regions. The fundus is the widest portion and tapers medially into the body, which in turn narrows to become the neck. The neck angles slightly superiorly as it approaches the hepatic duct. The cystic duct is 1–2 cm (less than 1 in) long and turns inferiorly as it bridges the neck and hepatic duct. The simple columnar epithelium of the gallbladder mucosa is organized in rugae, similar to those of the stomach. There is no submucosa in the gallbladder wall. The wall’s middle, muscular coat is made of smooth muscle fibers. When these fibers contract, the gallbladder’s contents are ejected through the cystic duct and into the bile duct (Figure 23.27). Visceral peritoneum reflected from the liver capsule holds the gallbladder against the liver and forms the outer coat of the gallbladder. The gallbladder's mucosa absorbs water and ions from bile, concentrating it by up to 10-fold."
"What process is used for cell growth, repair of cuts and replacement of worn out cells?",pollination,reproduction,binary fission,cell division,"Yes, just like this car, cells cannot last forever. Cells do eventually wear out. At that point, they need to be replaced. This is one reason that your cells divide. New cells that result after cells divide are also used for growth and to repair cuts."
What do astronomers term the stretching of space that causes the distance between galaxies to increase?,contracting universe,maintaining universe,draining universe,expanding universe,"An inflating balloon is not exactly like the expanding Universe. The surface of a balloon has only two dimensions, while space has three dimensions. But it is true that space itself is stretching out between galaxies like the rubber stretches when a balloon is inflated. This stretching of space, which causes the distance between galaxies to increase, is what astronomers mean by the expansion of the Universe."
What are the two types of digestive systems invertebrates may have?,gastric and monogastric,complete and simple,complete and fluid,complete and incomplete,Invertebrates have one of two types of digestive system. They are called incomplete and complete digestive systems. Both are shown in Figure below . An incomplete digestive system consists of a digestive cavity with one opening. The single opening serves as both mouth and anus. A complete digestive system consists of a digestive tract with two openings. One opening is the mouth. The other is the anus.

Why is the life cycle of plants so complex?,asexual reproduction,metamorphosis,pollination process,alternation of generation,"The life cycle of all plants is complex because it is characterized by alternation of generations. Plants alternate between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations, and between sexual and asexual reproduction. The ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually gives plants the flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Their complex life cycle allows for great variation."
"While elements are represented by chemical symbols, chemical formulas represent what?",solutions,extracts,pollutants,compounds,"Elements are represented by chemical symbols. Examples are H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Compounds are represented by chemical formulas . You’ve already seen the chemical formula for water. It’s H 2 O. The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water. The O for oxygen has no subscript. When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used. Table below shows some other examples of compounds and their chemical formulas."

Organs of the digestive system are shown in Figure below . Most of the organs make up the gastrointestinal tract . The rest of the organs are called accessory organs .
What is the transition from solid to vapor is called?,ionization,vaporization,deposition,sublimation,"Sublimation is the transition from solid to vapor phase. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water, or the disappearance of ice cubes in a freezer. The reverse is also true: Frost can form on very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. A popular effect is the making of “smoke” from dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide. Sublimation occurs because the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero. Certain air fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to inject a perfume into the room. Moth balls are a slightly toxic example of a phenol (an organic compound) that sublimates, while some solids, such as osmium tetroxide, are so toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-produced vapors."
"In contrast with cnidarians, nematodes show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. these animals are pseudocoelomates and show the presence of a complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and this?",stomach,mucus,hairs,anus,"present in all habitats with a large number of individuals of each species present in each. The free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively used as a model system in laboratories all over the world. Morphology In contrast with cnidarians, nematodes show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. These animals are pseudocoelomates and show the presence of a complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and anus. This is in contrast with the cnidarians, where only one opening is present (an incomplete digestive system). The cuticle of Nematodes is rich in collagen and a carbohydrate-protein polymer called chitin, and forms an external “skeleton” outside the epidermis. The cuticle also lines many of the organs internally, including the pharynx and rectum. The epidermis can be either a single layer of cells or a syncytium, which is a multinucleated cell formed from the fusion of uninucleated cells. The overall morphology of these worms is cylindrical, as seen in Figure 28.31. The head is radially symmetrical. A mouth opening is present at the anterior end with three or six lips as well as teeth in some species in the form of cuticle extensions. Some nematodes may present other external modifications like rings, head shields, or warts. Rings, however, do not reflect true internal body segmentation. The mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end. The muscles of nematodes differ from those of most animals: They have a longitudinal layer only, which accounts for the whip-like motion of their movement."
The amount of heat required to raise a single mass unit of a substance by a single temperature unit is known as what?,solitary heat,temperature variation,specific gravity,specific heat,"When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature. The amount of temperature increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made. When you add the same amount of heat to the same mass of different substances, the amount of temperature increase is different. Each substance has a specific heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit."
What is the most important source of electromagnetic radiation on earth?,the oceans,the moon,volcanos,the sun,"The most important source of electromagnetic radiation on Earth is the sun. Electromagnetic waves travel from the sun to Earth across space and provide virtually all the energy that supports life on our planet. Many other sources of electromagnetic waves that people use depend on technology. Radio waves, microwaves, and X rays are examples.

The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same what?,fuel,temperature,mass,energy,"The number of molecular orbitals produced is the same as the number of atomic orbitals used to create them (the law of conservation of orbitals). As the overlap between two atomic orbitals increases, the difference in energy between the resulting bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals increases. When two atomic orbitals combine to form a pair of molecular orbitals, the bonding molecular orbital is stabilized about as much as the antibonding molecular orbital is destabilized. The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same energy."
What occurs when competing species evolve different adaptations?,Rate Adaption,evolution,urbanization,specialization,"Instead of extinction, interspecific competition may lead to greater specialization.

Salts that are neither acidic nor basic do not affect what property of the solution when dissolved in water?,density,homeostasis,saturation,ph,"The simplest situation is a salt formed by combining a strong acid and a strong base. These salts are neither acidic nor basic, so they do not affect the pH of the solution when dissolved in water. For example, the ionic compound NaNO 3 could be prepared by combining the strong acid HNO 3 and the strong base NaOH. If we were to dissolve NaNO 3 in water, it would dissociate into Na + and NO 3 - ions. Neither ion is a strong enough acid or base to cause any noticeable proton transfers, so the pH of the pure water is not altered."
What protects the pollen of seed plants and spores of seedless plants?,chlorophyll,cystosol,cocklebur,sporopollenin,"The spores of seedless plants and the pollen of seed plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin. This substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids, and gives most pollen its yellow color. Sporopollenin is unusually resistant to chemical and biological degradation. Its toughness explains the existence of well-preserved fossils of pollen. Sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants; however, the green algae Coleochaetes is now known to form spores that contain sporopollenin. Protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants. The vulnerable embryo must be sheltered from desiccation and other environmental hazards. In both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides nutrition, and in seed plants, the embryo is also protected as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte."

The Jewel Box, shown in Figure below , is an open cluster. Open clusters tend to be blue in color, and often contain glowing gas and dust. The stars in an open cluster are young stars that all formed from the same nebula."
"Expansion of a gas into a vacuum is irreversible because the external pressure is measurably less than the internal pressure of the gas, and no states of what exist?",composition,balance,liquid,equilibrium,"can continue indefinitely. In contrast, the expansion of a gas into a vacuum (Pext = 0) is irreversible because the external pressure is measurably less than the internal pressure of the gas. No equilibrium states exist, and the gas expands irreversibly. When gas escapes from a microscopic hole in a balloon into a vacuum, for example, the process is irreversible; the direction of airflow cannot change. Because work done during the expansion of a gas depends on the opposing external pressure (w = PextΔV), work done in a reversible process is always equal to or greater than work done in a corresponding irreversible process: wrev ≥ wirrev. Whether a process is reversible or irreversible, ΔE = q + w. Because E is a state function, the magnitude of ΔE does not depend on reversibility and is independent of the path taken. So Equation 18.14."
"One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action—the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or called this?",pressure tube,melting tube,cohesive tube,capillary tube,"One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action—the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube. This action causes blood to be drawn into a small-diameter tube when the tube touches a drop. Capillary Action The tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube, is called capillary action. If a capillary tube is placed vertically into a liquid, as shown in Figure 11.34, capillary action will raise or suppress the liquid inside the tube depending on the combination of substances. The actual effect depends on the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces and, thus, the contact angle θ given in the table. If θ is less than 90º , then the fluid will be raised; if θ is greater than 90º , it will be suppressed. Mercury, for example, has a very large surface tension and a large contact angle with glass. When placed in a tube, the surface of a column of mercury curves downward, somewhat like a drop. The curved surface of a fluid in a tube is called a meniscus. The tendency of surface tension is always to reduce the surface area. Surface tension thus flattens the curved liquid surface in a capillary tube. This results in a downward force in mercury and an upward force in water, as seen in Figure 11.34."

They occupy a wide range of ecological positions. Raptors are carnivores; aquatic birds eat fish or water plants; and perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar. Some birds are pollinators that co-evolved with plants. Human actions have caused the extinction of hundreds of species of birds, and some 1,200 species are threatened with extinction today."
The hydrogen is oxidized because it undergoes a partial loss of what?,ions,density,protons,electrons,"In the course of this reaction, electrons are shifted away from each hydrogen atom and towards the oxygen atom. The hydrogen is oxidized because it undergoes a partial loss of electrons. Even though the loss is not complete enough to form ions, the hydrogen atoms in water have less electron density near them than they did in the H 2 molecule. The oxygen is reduced because it undergoes a partial gain of electrons. The oxygen atom in water has greater electron density near it than they did in the O 2 molecule."

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. a change that releases heat is called what?,biochemical process,magnetic process,oxidized process,exothermic process,"Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic process—this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torch’s flame (Figure 5.7). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process. A cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold."

What two types of tissue compose most of the non-pregnant and non-lactating female breast?,scar and collagenous,intestine and collagenous,silicone and collagenous,adipose and collagenous,"Structure of the Lactating Breast Mammary glands are modified sweat glands. The non-pregnant and non-lactating female breast is composed primarily of adipose and collagenous tissue, with mammary glands making up a very minor proportion of breast volume. The mammary gland is composed of milk-transporting lactiferous ducts, which expand and branch extensively during pregnancy in response to estrogen, growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin. Moreover, in response to progesterone, clusters of breast alveoli bud from the ducts and expand outward toward the chest wall. Breast alveoli are balloon-like structures lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells, or lactocytes, that are surrounded by a net of contractile myoepithelial cells. Milk is secreted from the lactocytes, fills the alveoli, and is squeezed into the ducts. Clusters of alveoli that drain to a common duct are called lobules; the lactating female has 12–20 lobules organized radially around the nipple. Milk drains from lactiferous ducts into lactiferous sinuses that meet at 4 to 18 perforations in the nipple, called nipple pores. The small bumps of the areola (the darkened skin around the nipple) are called Montgomery glands. They secrete oil to cleanse the nipple opening and prevent chapping and cracking of the nipple during breastfeeding."
"Control of the body can be somatic or autonomic, offering one way to divide what organ system by function?",central system,cardiovascular system,circulatory system,nervous system,"Functional Divisions of the Nervous System The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of its functions, but anatomical divisions and functional divisions are different. The CNS and the PNS both contribute to the same functions, but those functions can be attributed to different regions of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus) or to different ganglia in the periphery. The problem with trying to fit functional differences into anatomical divisions is that sometimes the same structure can be part of several functions. For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the retina that are either used for the conscious perception of visual stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the reflexive responses of smooth muscle tissue that are processed through the hypothalamus. There are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided functionally. First, the basic functions of the nervous system are sensation, integration, and response. Secondly, control of the body can be somatic or autonomic—divisions that are largely defined by the structures that are involved in the response. There is also a region of the peripheral nervous system that is called the enteric nervous system that is responsible for a specific set of the functions within the realm of autonomic control related to gastrointestinal functions."
What is the female reproductive structure of a flower?,the flower,the stamen,the seed,the pistil,"The pistil is the female reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stigma, style , and ovary . The stigma is raised and sticky to help it catch pollen. The style supports the stigma and connects it to the ovary, which contains the egg. Petals attract pollinators to the flower. Petals are often brightly colored so pollinators will notice them."
Cysteine is a type of what fundamental building block of protein?,salts acid,atoms acid,proteins acid,amino acid,"Food and Drink App: Amino Acids—Essential and Otherwise The text mentioned cysteine, an amino acid. Amino acids are the fundamental building blocks of proteins, a major biological component. Proteins are a necessary part of the diet; meat, eggs, and certain vegetables such as beans and soy are good sources of protein and amino acids. All life on Earth—from the lowliest single-celled organism to humans to blue whales—relies on proteins for life, so all life on Earth is dependent on amino acids. The human body contains 20 different amino acids (curiously, other organisms may have a different number of amino acids). However, not all of them must be obtained from the diet. The body can synthesize 12 amino acids. The other 8 mustbe obtained from the diet. These 8 amino acids are called the essential amino acids. Daily requirements range from 4 mg per kilogram of body weight for tryptophan to 40 mg per kilogram of body weight for leucine. Infants and children need a greater mass per kg of body weight to support their growing bodies; also, the number of amino acids that are considered essential for infants and children is greater than for adults due to the greater protein synthesis associated with growth. Because of the existence of essential amino acids, a diet that is properly balanced in protein is necessary. Rice and beans, a very popular food dish Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books."
"The leaves of what plant genus are the source of the compound ephedrine, which is used in medicine as a potent decongestant and is similar to amphetamines?",additive,Stimulant,dietary,ephedra,"years. The genus Ephedra is represented in North America in dry areas of the southwestern United States and Mexico (Figure 14.23). Ephedra’s small, scale-like leaves are the source of the compound ephedrine, which is used in medicine as a potent decongestant. Because ephedrine is similar to amphetamines, both in chemical structure and neurological effects, its use is restricted to prescription drugs. Like angiosperms, but unlike other gymnosperms, all gnetophytes possess vessel elements in their xylem."
The simplest organic compounds are known as what?,nucleotides,amino acids,carbohydrates,hydrocarbons,"Opening Essay Hydrocarbons are the simplest organic compounds, but they have interesting physiological effects. These effects depend on the size of the hydrocarbon molecules and where on or in the body they are applied. Alkanes of low molar mass—those with from 1 to approximately 10 or so carbon atoms—are gases or light liquids that act as anesthetics. Inhaling (“sniffing”) these hydrocarbons in gasoline or aerosol propellants for their intoxicating effect is a major health problem that can lead to liver, kidney, or brain damage or to immediate death by asphyxiation by excluding oxygen. Swallowed, liquid alkanes do little harm while in the stomach. In the lungs, however, they cause “chemical” pneumonia by dissolving fatlike molecules from cell membranes in the tiny air sacs (alveoli). The lungs become unable to expel fluids, just as in pneumonia caused by bacteria or viruses. People who swallow gasoline or other liquid alkane mixtures should not be made to vomit, as this would increase the chance of getting alkanes into the lungs. (There is no home-treatment antidote for gasoline poisoning; call a poison control center. ) Liquid alkanes with approximately 5–16 carbon atoms per molecule wash away natural skin oils and cause drying and chapping of the skin, while heavier liquid alkanes (those with approximately 17 or more carbon atoms per molecule) act as emollients (skin softeners). Such alkane mixtures as mineral oil and petroleum jelly can be applied as a protective film. Water and aqueous solutions such as urine will not dissolve such a film, which explains why petroleum jelly protects a baby’s tender skin from diaper rash."
"Who developed a classification system that divided living things into several groups that we still use today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles?",harrold,jung,darwin,aristotle,"People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years.

"Practitioners of what thought all matter was composed of different proportions of four basic elements, and that if you changed the proportions of these elements, you could change the substance itself?",phrenology,chemistry,biology,alchemy,"Alchemy was a somewhat mystical and secretive approach to learning how to manipulate matter. Practitioners, called alchemists, thought that all matter was composed of different proportions of the four basic elements—fire, water, earth, and air—and believed that if you changed the relative proportions of these elements in a substance, you could change the substance. The long-standing attempts to “transmute” common metals into gold represented one goal of alchemy. Alchemy’s other major goal was to synthesize the philosopher’s stone, a material that could impart long life—even immortality. Alchemists used symbols to represent substances, some of which are shown in the accompanying figure. This was not done to better communicate ideas, as chemists do today, but to maintain the secrecy of alchemical knowledge, keeping others from sharing in it."
What are atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons called?,opposites,reactions,organisms,isotopes,"The first plants were probably similar to the stoneworts in Figure below . Stoneworts are green algae. Like stoneworts, the first plants were aquatic. They may have had stalks but not stems. They also may have had hair-like structures called rhizoids but not roots. The first plants probably had male and female reproductive organs and needed water to reproduce. In stoneworts, sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs."
What is added to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution to achieve a particular concentration?,pigment,water,yeast,solvent,"Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of common laboratory reagents (Figure 3.17)."

"Because optics fibers are thin, entering light may strike the inside surface at greater than the critical angle, requiring attention to what?",wavelength,reflective point,electromagnetic index,refractive index,"Fiber Optics: Endoscopes to Telephones Fiber optics is one application of total internal reflection that is in wide use. In communications, it is used to transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals. Fiber optics employs the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass. Because the fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected (See Figure 25.14. ) The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is easily satisfied by coating the outside of the fiber with a material having an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal refraction. Rays are reflected around corners as shown, making the fibers into tiny light pipes."

"Club mosses, horsetails, ferns, and whisk ferns are examples of what type of plants?",angiosperms,cycads,gymnosperms,seedless vascular plants,"Seedless Vascular Plants By the Late Devonian period (385 million years ago), plants had evolved vascular tissue, well-defined leaves, and root systems. With these advantages, plants increased in height and size. During the Carboniferous period (359–299 million years ago), swamp forests of club mosses and horsetails, with some specimens reaching more than 30 meters tall, covered most of the land. These forests gave rise to the extensive coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous its name. In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte became the dominant phase of the lifecycle. Water is still required for fertilization of seedless vascular plants, and most favor a moist environment. Modern-day seedless vascular plants include club mosses, horsetails, ferns, and whisk ferns. Club Mosses The club mosses, or Lycophyta, are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants. They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous period, growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests. Today’s club mosses are diminutive, evergreen plants consisting of a stem (which may be branched) and small leaves called microphylls (Figure 14.13). The division Lycophyta consists of close to 1,000 species, including quillworts (Isoetales), club mosses (Lycopodiales), and spike mosses (Selaginellales): none of which is a true moss."

A vector is an organism that carries what disease-causing microorganisms from one person or animal to another?,genome,microbe,microbe,pathogen,"Still other pathogens are spread by vectors . A vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another. Most vectors are insects, such as ticks and mosquitoes. These insects tend to transfer protozoan or viral parasites. When an insect bites an infected person or animal, it picks up the pathogen. Then the pathogen travels to the next person or animal it bites. Ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Mosquitoes ( Figure below ) carry West Nile virus. Both pathogens cause fever, headache, and tiredness. If the diseases are not treated, more serious symptoms may develop. Other diseases spread by mosquitoes include Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever."

There would be nothing for the rocket to push against. But they do work! Fuel is ignited in a chamber. The gases in the chamber explode. The explosion creates pressure that forces the gases out of one side of the rocket. The rocket moves in the opposite direction ( Figure below ). The force pushing the rocket is called thrust ."
What once most common bird in north america became extinct in the 1800s?,the rock penguin,the dodo,the homing piegon,the passenger piegon,"Hundreds of species of birds have gone extinct as a result of human actions. A well-known example is the passenger pigeon. It was once the most common bird in North America, but overhunting and habitat destruction led to its extinction in the 1800s. Habitat destruction and use of the pesticide DDT explain the recent extinction of the dusky seaside sparrow. This native Florida bird was declared extinct in 1990."
What is the process called where nitrogen is repeatedly recycled through the biosphere?,nitrogen path,ammonia cycle,water cycle,nitrogen cycle,"Like water and carbon, nitrogen is also repeatedly recycled through the biosphere. This process is called the nitrogen cycle . Nitrogen is one of the most common elements in living organisms. It is important for creating both proteins and nucleic acids, like DNA. The air that we breathe is mostly nitrogen gas (N 2 ), but, unfortunately, animals and plants cannot use the nitrogen when it is a gas. In fact, plants often die from a lack of nitrogen even through they are surrounded by plenty of nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas (N 2 ) has two nitrogen atoms connected by a very strong triple bond. Most plants and animals cannot use the nitrogen in nitrogen gas because they cannot break that triple bond."

"Schrödinger’s approach uses three quantum numbers (n, l, and ml) to specify any of what type of function, associated with a particular energy?",rush function,shift function,green function,wave function,"Each wave function is associated with a particular energy. As in Bohr’s model, the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized; it can have only certain allowed values. The major difference between Bohr’s model and Schrödinger’s approach is that Bohr had to impose the idea of quantization arbitrarily, whereas in Schrödinger’s approach, quantization is a natural consequence of describing an electron as a standing wave. Quantum Numbers Schrödinger’s approach uses three quantum numbers (n, l, and ml) to specify any wave function. The quantum numbers provide information about the spatial distribution of an electron. Although n can be any positive integer, only certain values of l and ml are allowed for a given value of n. The Principal Quantum Number The principal quantum number (n) tells the average relative distance of an electron from the nucleus:."
"What is the term for the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus?",conductivity,magnetism,electrical attraction,radioactivity,"Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation . Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. They are unstable because they have too much energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For example, all elements with more than 83 protons—such as uranium, radium, and polonium—have unstable nuclei. They are called radioactive elements. The nuclei of these elements must lose protons to become more stable. When they do, they become different elements."

What model describing atomic structure is often referred to as a planetary model?,Pascal model,Newton's model,kinetic model,bohr model,"According to the Bohr model, often referred to as a planetary model , the electrons encircle the nucleus of the atom in specific allowable paths called orbits. When the electron is in one of these orbits, its energy is fixed. The ground state of the hydrogen atom, where its energy is lowest, is when the electron is in the orbit that is closest to the nucleus. The orbits that are further from the nucleus are all of successively greater energy. The electron is not allowed to occupy any of the spaces in between the orbits. An everyday analogy to the Bohr model is the rungs of a ladder. As you move up or down a ladder, you can only occupy specific rungs and cannot be in the spaces in between rungs. Moving up the ladder increases your potential energy, while moving down the ladder decreases your energy."

A reaction producing heat is what type of reaction?,physical,chemistry,carbon,chemical,"In the last lesson, we began investigating how a chemical equation can represent a given chemical reaction. In this lesson, we are going to study the ways in which chemical reactions are classified. There are literally thousands of chemical reactions that take place every day in our lives. Some reactions take place in the atmosphere, such as the combustion of fossil fuels. Others occur in solution, like the reactions responsible for photosynthesis or the reactions that break down our food to give us energy. Chemical reactions can take place in a variety of environments. Reactions happen on the sea floor, in our cells, and in the upper atmosphere. As we look at chemical reactions, we notice some commonalities and trends. When we studied the elements, we saw characteristics that allowed us to categorize them by family. There are also various ways to categorize chemical reactions. Some reactions produce heat, while others consume it. Some reactions are spontaneous, while others are not. Some reactions happen in nanoseconds, while others happen over longer spans of time. Some produce electricity, some emit light, and some release gaseous products. The products of chemical reactions tell us a lot about the chemistry of the process. In the above video, we see mercury(II) oxide decomposing into elemental mercury and oxygen gas. Decomposition was one of the first reaction types to be identified by chemists. Decomposition is one type of reaction you'll learn about in this lesson."

For the most part, this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them; they have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, pH, temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites. Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell. In other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could be cultured previously. Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state. The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival. The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood. In a process called resuscitation, the prokaryote can go back to “normal” life when environmental conditions improve. Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters are non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under laboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive? Microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a process called amplification."
What are living things that produce food for themselves and other organisms called?,refiners,growers,harvesters,producers,Producers are living things that produce food for themselves and other organisms. They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds. Producers are vital to all ecosystems because all organisms need organic compounds for energy.

What term means the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms?,ceramics,metamorphisis,introversion,metallurgy,"Very few of the transition metals are found in nature as free metals. Consequently, almost all metallic elements must be isolated from metal oxide or metal sulfide ores. Metallurgy is the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity. Many ores contain relatively low concentrations of the desired metal; for example, copper ores that contain even 1% Cu by mass are considered commercially useful. After an ore has been mined, the first step in processing is usually to crush it because the rate of chemical reactions increases dramatically with increased surface area. Next, one of three general strategies is used to separate and concentrate the compound(s) of interest: settling and flotation, which are based on differences in density between the desired compound and impurities; pyrometallurgy, which uses chemical reduction at high temperatures; and hydrometallurgy, which employs chemical or electrochemical reduction of an aqueous solution of the metal. Other methods that take advantage of unusual physical or chemical properties of a particular compound may also be used. For example, crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) are tiny but rather powerful magnets; in fact, magnetite (also known as lodestone) was used to make the first compasses in China during the first century BC. If a crushed ore that contains magnetite is passed through a powerful magnet, the Fe3O4 particles are attracted to the poles of the magnet, allowing them to be easily separated from other minerals."
What blood-carrying structures contain one-way valves that contribute to the return of blood to the heart?,brains,glands,clots,veins,
What type of components of the biosphere do chemical elements and water pass through during ecosystem recycle?,water and air,photic and aphotic,tropic and subtropic,biotic and abiotic,"The chemical elements and water that are needed by organisms continuously recycle in ecosystems. They pass through biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere. That’s why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles . For example, a chemical might move from organisms ( bio ) to the atmosphere or ocean ( geo ) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a cycle."
The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called what?,protein,rna,dna,genetic code,"The Genetic Code To summarize what we know to this point, the cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters. Each amino acid is defined by a threenucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the genetic code. Given the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Using a three-nucleotide code means that there are a total of 64 (4 × 4 × 4) possible combinations; therefore, a given amino acid is encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet (Figure 9.20)."
"Traditionally, what preventative measure used weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms or viruses to stimulate the immune system?",pathogen,infection,assimilation,vaccine,"Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms or viruses to stimulate the immune system. Modern techniques use specific genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors and mass-produced in bacteria to make large quantities of specific substances to stimulate the immune system. The substance is then used as a vaccine. In some cases, such as the H1N1 flu vaccine, genes cloned from the virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus. Antibiotics kill bacteria and are naturally produced by microorganisms such as fungi; penicillin is perhaps the most wellknown example. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells. The fungal cells have typically been genetically modified to improve the yields of the antibiotic compound. Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of the human hormone insulin in E. coli as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in many humans because of differences in the insulin molecule. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders."

"A sealed, vacuum-insulated reaction flask approximates what condition, in which neither matter nor heat can be exchanged between system and surroundings?",sure system,shared system,changing system,isolated system,"Depending on the specific setup, a few different types of systems can be described. In an open system , both matter and heat can be freely exchanged between the reaction container (the system) and the surroundings. An example would be an open beaker, where any gaseous materials or vaporized molecules are free to leave the system and float off into the atmosphere. In a closed system , matter cannot enter or leave, but heat can flow between the system and surroundings. A stoppered reaction flask would be an example of a closed system. Finally, a situation in which neither matter nor heat can be exchanged between system and surroundings is referred to as an isolated system . Although truly isolated systems are not really possible, a sealed, vacuum-insulated reaction flask would come very close."
A metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and this?,layer,tendon,electron,capillary,"Metarterioles and Capillary Beds A metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and a capillary. Slightly larger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries. Each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10–100 capillaries. The precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. Their function is critical: If all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. Normally, the precapillary sphincters are closed. When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (Figure 20.6). If all of the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. This creates what is known as a vascular shunt. In addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system. Although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular, pulsating flow. This pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to changes in."

"Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides are types of what kind of macromolecule?",nutrients,glucose,protein,carbohydrate,"3.2 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell and provide structural support to plant cells, fungi, and all of the arthropods that include lobsters, crabs, shrimp, insects, and spiders. Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers in the molecule. Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. Glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. The long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched. Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. Storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell."
What action do particles of the same charge do to each other?,pull,propagate,destroy,repel,"Matter and Antimatter The positron was only the first example of antimatter. Every particle in nature has an antimatter counterpart, although some particles, like the photon, are their own antiparticles. Antimatter has charge opposite to that of matter (for example, the positron is positive while the electron is negative) but is nearly identical otherwise, having the same mass, intrinsic spin, half-life, and so on. When a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of photons as seen in Figure 33.13. Neutral particles, such as neutrons, have neutral antimatter counterparts, which also annihilate when they interact. Certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live 0 −8 correspondingly short lives. For example, the neutral pion π is its own antiparticle and has a half-life about 10 shorter than + − π and π , which are each other’s antiparticles. Without exception, nature is symmetric—all particles have antimatter counterparts. For example, antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in 1956 and the antiproton is negative. Antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at CERN, too. It is possible to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that they don't annihilate with other particles. However, particles of the same charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. It is not currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. At any rate, we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not there. But this knowledge does raise another question—why is there such a predominance of matter and so little antimatter? Possible explanations emerge later in this and the next chapter."
A cold front is formed when a cold air mass runs into what?,dry air mass,hurricane,cool air mass,warm air mass,"A cold front forms when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass ( Figure below ). The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass. So the cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. If the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy. Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very strong along a cold front."

Light is a form of what kind of energy?,gravitational energy,magnetic energy,static energy,electromagnetic energy,
"When compared to anaerobic respiration, what does aerobic respiration release more of?",pressure,heat,carbon dioxide,energy,"A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it releases. Without oxygen, organisms can just split glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than anaerobic respiration."
"As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within what bone structure?",chest,skeleton,spine,skull,"As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within the skull. The telencephalon is the most anterior region of what was the neural tube, but cannot grow past the limit of the frontal bone of the skull. Because the cerebrum fits into this space, it takes on a C-shaped formation, through the frontal, parietal, occipital, and finally temporal regions. The space within the telencephalon is stretched into this same C-shape. The two ventricles are in the left and right sides, and were at one time referred to as the first and second ventricles. The interventricular foramina connect the frontal region of the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. The third ventricle is the space bounded by the medial walls of the hypothalamus and thalamus. The two thalami touch in the center in most brains as the massa intermedia, which is surrounded by the third ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct opens just inferior to the epithalamus and passes through the midbrain. The tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roof and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively. The aqueduct opens up into the fourth ventricle. The floor of the fourth ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum of the midbrain). The fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord. The ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. The single median aperture and the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around the outside of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called a choroid plexus. Ependymal cells (one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system) surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF. The fluid is a clear solution with a limited amount of the constituents of blood. It is essentially water, small molecules, and electrolytes. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved into the CSF, as they are in blood, and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue."

What is the si unit for weight?,pounds (lbs),kilograms (kg),meters (m),newton (n),"Weight measures the force of gravity pulling on an object. Because weight measures force, the SI unit for weight is the newton (N) . On Earth, a mass of 1 kilogram has a weight of about 10 newtons because of the pull of Earth’s gravity On the moon, which has less gravity, the same mass would weigh less. Weight is measured with a scale, like the spring scale in Figure below . The scale measures the force with which gravity pulls an object downward."

"Recent evidence indicates some of what type of cells remain within the heart, continuing to divide and potentially replace dead cells?",dendritic cells,osteoclast cells,human cells,stem cells,"Repair and Replacement Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show some proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. To date, myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells seem to be nonfunctional, although those grown in Petri dishes (in vitro) do beat. Perhaps soon this mystery will be solved, and new advances in treatment will be commonplace."
About what percentage of the earth's water is fresh water?,thirty percent,two percent,nine percent,three percent,"Of all the water on Earth, about two percent is stored underground in spaces between rocks. A fraction of a percent exists in the air as water vapor, clouds, or precipitation. Another fraction of a percent occurs in the bodies of plants and animals. So where is most of Earth’s water? It’s on the surface of the planet. In fact, water covers about 70 percent of Earth’s surface. Of water on Earth’s surface, 97 percent is salt water, mainly in the ocean. Only 3 percent is fresh water . Most of the fresh water is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining fresh water occurs in rivers, lakes, and other fresh water features."

"What is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food, and involves measuring biomass in terrestrial environments?",trophic level total,food chain,decomposition energy,net primary productivity,"Abiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic matter available as food (net primary productivity). Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is an important variable when considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass. Annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment. Environments with the greatest amount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are optimized. The climate of these areas is warm and wet. Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. The aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. Conversely, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. The animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in available food."
"Twenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature what?",zygote,spermatozoa,fetus,oocyte,"Human Gestation Twenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte. When fertilized (at conception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.18). The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo. Pregnancy tests determine the level of β-HCG in urine or serum. If the hormone is present, the test is positive."
Oxygen is combined with what to form water?,carbon,glucose,helium,hydrogen,"Photosynthesis makes the glucose that is used in cellular respiration to make ATP. The glucose is then turned back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. While water is broken down to form oxygen during photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen to form water. While photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is the released oxygen that is used by us and most other organisms for cellular respiration. We breathe in that oxygen, which is carried through our blood to all our cells. In our cells, oxygen allows cellular respiration to proceed. Cellular respiration works best in the presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, much less ATP would be produced."
Does lava flow quickly or slowly when thick?,steadily,quickly,rapidly,slowly,"When lava is thick, it flows slowly. If thick lava makes it to the surface, it cannot flow far from the vent.

Any nucleus that is unstable and decays spontaneously is said to be what?,magnetic,neutral,dull,radioactive,"-16O817O17oxygen -17O818O18oxygen -18 Because the number of neutrons is equal to A − Z, we see that the first isotope of oxygen has 8 neutrons, the second isotope 9 neutrons, and the third isotope 10 neutrons. Isotopes of all naturally occurring elements on Earth are present in nearly fixed proportions, with each proportion constituting an isotope’s natural abundance. For example, in a typical terrestrial sample of oxygen, 99.76% of the O atoms is oxygen-16, 0.20% is oxygen-18, and 0.04% is oxygen-17. Any nucleus that is unstable and decays spontaneously is said to be radioactive, emitting subatomic particles and electromagnetic radiation. The emissions are collectively called radioactivity and can be measured. Isotopes that emit radiation are called radioisotopes. As you learned in Chapter 14 ""Chemical Kinetics"", the rate at which radioactive decay occurs is characteristic of the isotope and is generally reported as a half-life (t1/2), the amount of time required for half of the initial number of nuclei present to decay in a first-order reaction. (For more information on half-life, seeChapter 14 ""Chemical Kinetics"", Section 14.5 ""Half-Lives and Radioactive Decay Kinetics"". ) An isotope’s half-life can range from fractions of a second to billions of years and, among other applications, can be used to measure the age of ancient objects. Example 1 and its corresponding exercise review the calculations involving radioactive decay rates and half-lives."
What is the term for viscous magmas that are high in silica and tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively?,combustible magmas,sedimentary magmas,compacted magmas,felsic magmas,"The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher the viscosity. Viscosity is a liquid's resistance to flow. Viscous magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. These are felsic magmas, which are high in silica. When magma is fluid and runny, it is not viscous. This magma often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. These are low-silica mafic magmas."
How many meters deep does the photic zone extend?,900,400,100,200,The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters (656 feet) below the surface of the water. This is where enough sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. Algae and other photosynthetic organisms can make food and support food webs.
What is the name of the process in which the nuclei of uranium atoms are split?,nuclear fusion,critical fission,atomic fusion,nuclear fission,"Like fossil fuels, the radioactive element uranium can be used to generate electrical energy in power plants. In a nuclear power plant, the nuclei of uranium atoms are split in the process of nuclear fission. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy from just a small amount of uranium. The total supply of uranium in the world is quite limited, however, and cannot be replaced once it is used up. This makes nuclear energy a nonrenewable resource. Although using nuclear energy does not release carbon dioxide or cause air pollution, it does produce dangerous radioactive wastes. Accidents at nuclear power plants also have the potential to release large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. Figure below describes the nuclear disaster caused by a Japanese tsunami in 2011. You can learn more about the disaster and its aftermath at the URLs below."
What type of bonds are formed between atoms sharing electrons?,ionic,neutron bonds,hydroxyl,covalent,Covalent bonds are formed between atoms sharing electrons.
An individual virus is called what?,a pathogen,a toxin,a polymer,a virion,"An individual virus is called a virion. It is a tiny particle much smaller than a prokaryotic cell. Because viruses do not consist of cells, they also lack cell membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and other cell organelles. Without these structures, they are unable to make proteins or even reproduce on their own. Instead, they must depend on a host cell to synthesize their proteins and to make copies of themselves. Viruses infect and live inside the cells of living organisms. When viruses infect the cells of their host, they may cause disease. For example, viruses cause AIDS, influenza (flu), chicken pox, and the common cold."
What type of particle collides with an atom of u-235 during the basic nuclear fission process?,a proton,an electron,a nuclei,a neutron,"The example above illustrates the basic nuclear fission process. A neutron (generally produced by some controlled process, not usually a natural event) collides with an atom of U-235. Momentarily, a U-236 atom forms which then splits into two smaller atoms (Kr-93 and Ba-141) in the diagram.

"Often generated by molecular cloning, transgenic organisms possess what from a different species?",RNA,memories,organs,dna,"10.2 Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture Genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and can be used to benefit affected individuals and their relatives who have not developed disease symptoms yet. Gene therapy—by which functioning genes are incorporated into the genomes of individuals with a non-functioning mutant gene—has the potential to cure heritable diseases. Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic animals have been created for experimental purposes and some are used to produce some human proteins. Genes are inserted into plants, using plasmids in the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which infects plants. Transgenic plants have been created to improve the characteristics of crop plants—for example, by giving them insect resistance by inserting a gene for a bacterial toxin."

The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female; that is, they are homologous structures. Male Reproductive Anatomy In the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in) in size and divided into wedge-shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm. Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in Figure 43.8 so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the body at about 2° C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. Infertility can occur in land mammals when the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development."

What crucial role does beneficial fungi play?,killing bacteria,cleaning the soil,cleaning water,balance of ecosystems,"Beneficial Fungi Fungi play a crucial role in the balance of ecosystems. They colonize most habitats on Earth, preferring dark, moist conditions. They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms, like lichens. Fungi are not obvious in the way that large animals or tall trees are. Yet, like bacteria, they are major decomposers of nature. With their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter that is insoluble and would not be recycled otherwise. Importance to Ecosystems Food webs would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter and fungi are key participants in this process. Decomposition allows for cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the environment so they are available to living things, rather than being trapped in dead organisms. Fungi are particularly important because they have evolved enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin, components of plant cell walls that few other organisms are able to digest, releasing their carbon content. Fungi are also involved in ecologically important coevolved symbioses, both mutually beneficial and pathogenic with organisms from the other kingdoms. Mycorrhiza, a term combining the Greek roots myco meaning fungus and rhizo."

Soap acts as what kind of agent between grease and water?,sterilizing,lubricating,codifying,emulsifying,"Butter and mayonnaise are examples of a class of colloids called emulsions . An emulsion is a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid. A stable emulsion requires an emulsifying agent to be present. Mayonnaise is made in part of oil and vinegar. Since oil is nonpolar and vinegar is an aqueous solution and polar, the two do not mix and would quickly separate into layers. However, the addition of egg yolk causes the mixture to become stable and not separate. Egg yolk is capable of interacting with both the polar vinegar and the nonpolar oil. The egg yolk is called the emulsifying agent. Soap acts as an emulsifying agent between grease and water. Grease cannot be simply rinsed off your hands or another surface because it is insoluble. However, the soap stabilizes a grease-water mixture because one end of a soap molecule is polar and the other end is nonpolar. This allows the grease to be removed from your hands or your clothing by washing with soapy water."

Ions flow through atp synthase from the thylakoid space into the stroma in a process called known as what?,fertilization,oxidation,respiration,chemiosmosis,"5.2 The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis In the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reaction, pigment molecules absorb energy from sunlight. The most common and abundant pigment is chlorophyll a. A photon strikes photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. Energy travels through the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space. This forms an electrochemical gradient. The ions flow through ATP synthase from the thylakoid space into the stroma in a process called chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy carrier for the Calvin cycle reactions."
What is the name of microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plants?,notochord,chloroplasts,sphenopalatine,plasmodesmata,"Plasmodesmata (singular, plasmodesma ) are microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells and some algal cells. These junctions enable two cells to transport materials and communication between them. Plasmodesmata are similar to gap junctions of animal cells. Like gap junctions, plasmodesmata enable direct intercellular transport of substances between cells. However, unlike other junctions, plasmodesmata do not seem to be protein based. Rather, they are made from membrane and cell wall material. Plasmodesmata move various types of molecules, including transport proteins (including transcription factors), short interfering RNA, messenger RNA and viral genomes from cell to cell. A typical plant cell may have between 1,000 and 100,000 plasmodesmata connecting it with adjacent cells."

What is the term for the relatively stable state inside the body of an animal?,consciousness,metabolism,dormancy,homeostasis,"16.1 | Homeostasis and Osmoregulation By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the concept of homeostasis • Describe thermoregulation of endothermic and ectothermic animals • Explain how the kidneys serve as the main osmoregulatory organs in the human body Homeostasis refers to the relatively stable state inside the body of an animal. Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes in order to maintain this steady state. Examples of internal conditions maintained homeostatically are the level of blood glucose, body temperature, blood calcium level. These conditions remain stable because of physiologic processes that result in negative feedback relationships. If the blood glucose or calcium rises, this sends a signal to organs responsible for lowering blood glucose or calcium. The signals that restore the normal levels are examples of negative feedback. When homeostatic mechanisms fail, the results can be unfavorable for the animal. Homeostatic mechanisms keep the body in dynamic equilibrium by constantly adjusting to the changes that the body’s systems encounter. Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium. Two examples of factors that are regulated homeostatically are temperature and water content. The processes that maintain homeostasis of these two factors are called thermoregulation and osmoregulation."
What is the middle layer of connective tissue called?,pollenation,tendon,xerophyte,perimysium,"Inside each skeletal muscle, muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles, each called a fascicle, by a middle layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle, or fascicle of the muscle. Inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of collagen and reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the muscle fiber. These nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue. In skeletal muscles that work with tendons to pull on bones, the collagen in the three tissue layers (the mysia) intertwines with the collagen of a tendon. At the other end of the tendon, it fuses with the periosteum coating the bone. The tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia, to the tendon, and then to the periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton. In other places, the mysia may fuse with a broad, tendon-like sheet called an aponeurosis, or to fascia, the connective tissue between skin and bones. The broad sheet of connective tissue in the lower back that the latissimus dorsi muscles (the “lats”) fuse into is an example of an aponeurosis. Every skeletal muscle is also richly supplied by blood vessels for nourishment, oxygen delivery, and waste removal. In addition, every muscle fiber in a skeletal muscle is supplied by the axon branch of a somatic motor neuron, which signals the fiber to contract. Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, the only way to functionally contract a skeletal muscle is through signaling from the nervous system."
"Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are what?",expanding,multiple,simple,linear,"Telomere replication Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you’ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure 14.16) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated."

When the spores enter the respiratory tract, the immune system responds to them as though they were harmful microbes. Symptoms may include sneezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms are likely to be more severe in people with asthma or other respiratory diseases. Long-term exposure to mold spores may also weaken the immune system."
Which sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus and opens to allow the bolus to enter the stomach?,urethral sphincter,pupillary sphincter,pyloric sphincter,gastro-esophageal sphincter,"A ring-like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true."
What adaptation helps prey hide and predators sneak up on prey?,variation,scent,claws,camouflage,Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve through natural selection.

Bursitis is the inflammation of a bursa near what?,muscle,brain stem,lung,joint,"Bursitis Bursitis is the inflammation of a bursa near a joint. This will cause pain, swelling, or tenderness of the bursa and surrounding area, and may also result in joint stiffness. Bursitis is most commonly associated with the bursae found at or near the shoulder, hip, knee, or elbow joints. At the shoulder, subacromial bursitis may occur in the bursa that separates the acromion of the scapula from the tendon of a shoulder muscle as it passes deep to the acromion. In the hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just below the lateral side of the hip. Ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that separates the skin from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, the bony structure that is weight bearing when sitting. At the knee, inflammation and swelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is prepatellar bursitis (“housemaid’s knee”), a condition more commonly seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee pads. At the elbow, olecranon bursitis is inflammation of the bursa between the skin and olecranon process of the ulna. The olecranon forms the bony tip of the elbow, and bursitis here is also known as “student’s elbow. ” Bursitis can be either acute (lasting only a few days) or chronic. It can arise from muscle overuse, trauma, excessive or prolonged pressure on the skin, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or infection of the joint. Repeated acute episodes of bursitis can result in a chronic condition. Treatments for the disorder include antibiotics if the bursitis is caused by an infection, or anti-inflammatory agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids if the bursitis is due to trauma or overuse. Chronic bursitis may require that fluid be drained, but additional surgery is usually not required."
What is one thing that cell membranes are permeable to?,metals,nutrients,gas,specific ions,
What kind of a process is corrosion?,electromagnetic,electrolysis,oxidation,galvanic,"Note the Pattern Corrosion is a galvanic process. Under ambient conditions, the oxidation of most metals is thermodynamically spontaneous, with the notable exception of gold and platinum. Hence it is actually somewhat surprising that any metals are useful at all in Earth’s moist, oxygen-rich atmosphere. Some metals, however, are resistant to corrosion for kinetic reasons. For example, aluminum in soft-drink cans and airplanes is protected by a thin coating of metal oxide that forms on the surface of the metal and acts as an impenetrable barrier that prevents further destruction. Aluminum cans also have a thin plastic layer to prevent reaction of the oxide with acid in the soft drink. Chromium, magnesium, and nickel also form protective oxide films. Stainless steels are remarkably resistant to corrosion because they usually contain a significant proportion of chromium, nickel, or both. In contrast to these metals, when iron corrodes, it forms a red-brown hydrated metal oxide (Fe2O3·xH2O), commonly known as rust, that does not provide a tight protective film (Figure 19.17 ""Rust, the Result of Corrosion of."

"In a solution, what is the substance present in the lesser amount called?",fluids,molecules,compound,solute,"Most chemical reactions are carried out in solutions, which are homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances. In a solution, a solute (the substance present in the lesser amount) is dispersed in a solvent (the substance present in the greater amount). Aqueous solutions contain water as the solvent, whereas nonaqueous solutions have solvents other than water. Polar substances, such as water, contain asymmetric arrangements of polar bonds, in which electrons are shared unequally between bonded atoms. Polar substances and ionic compounds tend to be most soluble in water because they interact favorably with its structure. In aqueous solution, dissolved ions becomehydrated; that is, a shell of water molecules surrounds them. Substances that dissolve in water can be categorized according to whether the resulting aqueous solutions conduct electricity. Strong electrolytes dissociate completely into ions to produce solutions that conduct electricity well. Weak electrolytes produce a relatively small number of ions, resulting in solutions that conduct electricity poorly. Nonelectrolytes dissolve as uncharged molecules and have no effect on the electrical conductivity of water."

Because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in the lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large. The mammalian circulatory system is a closed system with double circulation passing through the lungs and the body. It consists of a network of vessels containing blood that circulates because of pressure differences generated by the heart. The heart contains two pumps that move blood through the pulmonary and systemic circulations. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. The signal for contraction begins in the wall of the right atrium. The electrochemical signal causes the two atria to contract in unison; then the signal causes the ventricles to contract. The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away from the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart."

"Which science is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines?",chronology,microbiology,neurobiology,ethology,"45.7 | Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Compare innate and learned behavior • Discuss how movement and migration behaviors are a result of natural selection • Discuss the different ways members of a population communicate with each other • Give examples of how species use energy for mating displays and other courtship behaviors • Differentiate between various mating systems • Describe different ways that species learn Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus. Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes. The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. Animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology. Although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches. Comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology. Ethology is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. Still, one cannot study behavioral biology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology. One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. Innate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. They are “hard wired” into the system. On the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to changes in the environment."

The two simplest models of population growth use what to describe the rate of change in the size of a population over time?,wave function,predestination equations,analogous equations,deterministic equations,"Population Growth The two simplest models of population growth use deterministic equations (equations that do not account for random events) to describe the rate of change in the size of a population over time. The first of these models, exponential growth, describes theoretical populations that increase in numbers without any limits to their growth. The second model, logistic growth, introduces limits to reproductive growth that become more intense as the population size increases. Neither model adequately describes natural populations, but they provide points of comparison. Exponential Growth Charles Darwin, in developing his theory of natural selection, was influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published his book in 1798 stating that populations with abundant natural resources grow very rapidly; however, they limit further growth by depleting their resources. The early pattern of accelerating population size is called exponential growth. The best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. In another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will divide, producing 4000 bacteria. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. The important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is itself increasing; that is, the."

Intrachain disulfide linkages are found in many proteins, including insulin (yellow bars in http://catalog. flatworldknowledge. com/bookhub/reader/2547 - gob-ch18_s04_s01_f01) and have a strong stabilizing effect on the tertiary structure."
What is the name for the energy waves that radiate out from the center of an earthquake?,particle waves,deep waves,volcanic waves,seismic waves,Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.
"During a human pregnancy, which trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery?",second trimester,fourth trimester,first trimester,third trimester,"43.5 Human Pregnancy and Birth Human pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and proceeds through the three trimesters of gestation. The labor process has three stages (contractions, delivery of the fetus, expulsion of the placenta), each propelled by hormones. The first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver. The second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems. The third trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery. Prevention of a pregnancy can be accomplished through a variety of methods including barriers, hormones, or other means. Assisted reproductive technologies may help individuals who have infertility problems."

Why is closed reduction simpler than open reduction in bone repair?,no treatment needed,no medicine needed,no pain pills needed,no surgery needed,"6.5 | Fractures: Bone Repair By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Differentiate among the different types of fractures • Describe the steps involved in bone repair A fracture is a broken bone. It will heal whether or not a physician resets it in its anatomical position. If the bone is not reset correctly, the healing process will keep the bone in its deformed position. When a broken bone is manipulated and set into its natural position without surgery, the procedure is called a closed reduction. Open reduction requires surgery to expose the fracture and reset the bone. While some fractures can be minor, others are quite severe and result in grave complications. For example, a fractured diaphysis of the femur has the potential to release fat globules into the bloodstream. These can become lodged in the capillary beds of the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and if not treated quickly, death."

What protects the brain and spinal cord in the central nervous system?,Flexing,neutrophils,dermis,meninges,"35.3 The Central Nervous System The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three meninges. The brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions. In mammals, these include the cortex (which can be broken down into four primary functional lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstem—although structures in some of these designations overlap. While functions may be primarily localized to one structure in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep, involve neurons in multiple brain regions. The spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its connections with peripheral nerves. It transmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor reflexes."

The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of what organism?,crustaceans,mushrooms,sediments,algae,"Water pollution comes from many sources. One of the biggest sources is runoff. Runoff picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the chemicals to bodies of water. The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of algae, creating algal blooms (see Figure below ). The algae use up oxygen in the water so that other aquatic organisms cannot survive. This has occurred over large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones , where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico. Measures that can help prevent these problems include cutting down on fertilizer use. Preserving wetlands also helps because wetlands filter runoff water."

"Water is considered a what since it is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, so ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it?",osmotic,solute,pigment,solvent,"Water’s Solvent Properties Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it. Therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules. This is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in Figure 2.15 and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. When ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when NaCl crystals are added to water, the molecules of NaCl dissociate into Na+ and Cl– ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in Figure 2.15. The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecule’s oxygen. The negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule."

They both occur at the same rate, so any overall change by one reaction is cancelled by the reverse reaction. We say that chemical equilibrium is dynamic, rather than static. Also, because both reactions are occurring simultaneously, the equilibrium can be written backward. For example, representing an equilibrium as."
What is the watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs and contains protective white blood cells but does not contain erythrocytes?,secretion,stomach,basil,lymph,"The Lymphatic System Lymph is the watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs and contains protective white blood cells but does not contain erythrocytes. Lymph moves about the body through the lymphatic system, which is made up of vessels, lymph ducts, lymph glands, and organs, such as tonsils, adenoids, thymus, and spleen. Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which include monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. Most cells in the blood are red blood cells. Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue). Recall that cells of the immune system originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas progenitor cells migrate from the bone marrow and develop and mature into naïve T cells in the organ called the thymus. On maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Figure 17.19). Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens."

Free fatty acids are carboxylic acids that contain long chains of what?,particles,vapors,lipds,hydrocarbons,"In the Figure below , we see the structures of some common classes of lipids. Free fatty acids are carboxylic acids that contain long hydrocarbon chains. Saturated fatty acids are alkanes with a single carboxylic acid, whereas unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more C-C double bonds. Fatty acids often form esters with one of the alcohol functional groups on glycerol , a three carbon chain in which each carbon is bonded to one OH group. Triglycerides are common structures, in which all three of these OH groups are esterified with a fatty acid. The three fatty acids in a triglyceride may be the same or different. Another common structure is a phospholipid, in which two of the alcohols in glycerol form esters with fatty acids, and the third is connected to a very polar phosphorus-containing group."

Without digestive enzymes, animals would not be able to break down food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they need to survive."
"After coming apart from the crystal, the individual ions are then surrounded by solvent particles in a process called what?",hydrolysis,osmosis,ionization,solvation,"After coming apart from the crystal, the individual ions are then surrounded by solvent particles in a process called solvation . Note that the individual Na + ions are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen atom oriented near the positive ion. Likewise, the chloride ions are surrounded by water molecules with the opposite orientation. Hydration is the process of solute particles being surrounded by water molecules arranged in a specific manner. Hydration helps to stabilize aqueous solutions by preventing the positive and negative ions from coming back together and forming a precipitate."
A battery is a multiple connection of what kind of cells?,localweather cells,cabri cells,organic cells,voltaic cells,"Multiple Voltage Sources There are two voltage sources when a battery charger is used. Voltage sources connected in series are relatively simple. When voltage sources are in series, their internal resistances add and their emfs add algebraically. (See Figure 21.15. ) Series connections of voltage sources are common—for example, in flashlights, toys, and other appliances. Usually, the cells are in series in order to produce a larger total emf. But if the cells oppose one another, such as when one is put into an appliance backward, the total emf is less, since it is the algebraic sum of the individual emfs. A battery is a multiple connection of voltaic cells, as shown in Figure 21.16. The disadvantage of series connections of cells is that their internal resistances add. One of the authors once owned a 1957 MGA that had two 6-V batteries in series, rather than a single 12-V battery. This arrangement produced a large internal resistance that caused him many problems in starting the engine."

The rocks athe mid-ocean ridge are nearly free of what?,metals,minerals,scratches,sediment,"Scientists discovered another way to tell the approximate age of seafloor rocks. The rocks at the mid-ocean ridge crest are nearly sediment free. The crust is also very thin there. With distance from the ridge crest, the sediments and crust get thicker. This also supports the idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis, and that the rocks get older with distance away from the ridge ( Figure below ). This is because the crust is new at the ridge, and so it is thin and has no sediment. The crust gets older away from the ridge crest. It has cooled and has more sediment."
What do we call a simple machine that consists of a rope and grooved wheel?,pedal,axle,lever,pulley,A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a rope and grooved wheel. Single pulleys may be fixed or moveable. Single and moveable pulleys may be combined in a compound pulley. The ideal mechanical advantage of a pulley or compound pulley is always equal to or greater than 1. Fixed pulleys and some compound pulleys also change the direction of the input force.
What do you call health-promoting molecules that inhibit the oxidation of other molecules?,hormones,neurotransmitters,nutrients,antioxidants,"Antioxidants are important for the health of a cell. An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons or hydrogen from a substance to an oxidizing agent, producing free radicals in the process. These free radicals initiate a chain reaction in the cell that can cause cell damage, or can lead to cell death. Antioxidants prevent these chain reactions from even initiating."
"In a correctly balanced equation, all coefficients must be what kind of numbers?",fractional,prime,negative,whole,"In a correctly balanced equation, all coefficients must be whole numbers.

"Asteroids, comets, and planets move around the sun in curved paths called what?",ellipticals,satellites,curves,orbits,"Earth and many other bodies—including asteroids, comets, and the other planets—move around the sun in curved paths called orbits. Generally, the orbits are elliptical, or oval, in shape. You can see the shape of Earth’s orbit in the Figure below . Because of the sun’s relatively strong gravity, Earth and the other bodies constantly fall toward the sun, but they stay far enough away from the sun because of their forward velocity to fall around the sun instead of into it. As a result, they keep orbiting the sun and never crash to its surface. The motion of Earth and the other bodies around the sun is called orbital motion . Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at the same time is pulled by gravity toward another object. You can explore orbital motion and gravity in depth with the animation at this URL:."
The primary motor cortex is located in which lobe of the brain?,Occipital,Parietal,Temporal lobe,frontal,"Primary Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum. Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The “power muscles” that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex."

The behavior of ideal gases is explained by what theory of gases?,kinetic theory,molecular theory,Charles's Law,kinetic molecular theory,"Summary The behavior of ideal gases is explained by the kinetic molecular theory of gases. Molecular motion, which leads to collisions between molecules and the container walls, explains pressure, and the large intermolecular distances in gases explain their high compressibility. Although all gases have the same average kinetic energy at a given temperature, they do not all possess the same root mean square (rms) speed (vrms). The actual values of speed and kinetic energy are not the same for all particles of a gas but are given by a Boltzmann distribution, in which some molecules have higher or lower speeds (and kinetic energies) than average. Diffusion is the gradual mixing of gases to form a sample of uniform composition even in the absence of mechanical agitation. In contrast,effusion is the escape of a gas from a container through a tiny opening into an evacuated space. The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass (Graham’s law), a relationship that closely approximates the rate of diffusion. As a result, light gases tend to diffuse and effuse much more rapidly than heavier gases. The mean free path of a molecule is the average distance it travels between collisions."

"The male gametophyte releases what, which swim - propelled by their flagella - to reach and fertilize the female gamete or egg?",dna,cytoplasm,tadpoles,sperm,"the pterophytes, from which modern ferns are derived. The life cycle of bryophytes and pterophytes is characterized by the alternation of generations. The completion of the life cycle requires water, as the male gametes must swim to the female gametes. The male gametophyte releases sperm, which must swim—propelled by their flagella—to reach and fertilize the female gamete or egg. After fertilization, the zygote matures and grows into a sporophyte, which in turn will form sporangia, or ""spore vessels,” in which mother cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores. The release of spores in a suitable environment will lead to germination and a new generation of gametophytes."

What system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon reinvasion of the same pathogen?,suggestive immune system,incorporate immune system,societal immune system,adaptive immune system,"Immunological Memory The adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon reinvasion of the same pathogen. Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the innate response. During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, called a primary response, plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells mature into effector cells, a subset of the naïve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities, as illustrated in Figure 42.16. A memory cell is an antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response, but that can immediately become effector cells upon re-exposure to the same pathogen. During the primary immune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses. As the infection is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the memory cells persist in the circulation."

"What term, calculated by multiplying heart contractions by stroke volume, means the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute?",blood output,liver output,respiratory output,cardiac output,"Blood Pressure Regulation Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. It is calculated by multiplying the number of heart contractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle). Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising. However, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength. Stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between contractions. During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. Stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the blood vessels, consequently increasing blood pressure. These changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and even standing up or lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure."

"Proteins are categorized according to shape and what property, which correlates with it?",salinity,viscosity,size,solubility,"Each of the thousands of naturally occurring proteins has its own characteristic amino acid composition and sequence that result in a unique three-dimensional shape. Since the 1950s, scientists have determined the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional conformation of numerous proteins and thus obtained important clues on how each protein performs its specific function in the body. Proteins are compounds of high molar mass consisting largely or entirely of chains of amino acids. Because of their great complexity, protein molecules cannot be classified on the basis of specific structural similarities, as carbohydrates and lipids are categorized. The two major structural classifications of proteins are based on far more general qualities: whether the protein is (1) fiberlike and insoluble or (2) globular and soluble. Some proteins, such as those that compose hair, skin, muscles, and connective tissue, are fiberlike. These fibrous proteins are insoluble in water and usually serve structural, connective, and protective functions. Examples of fibrous proteins are keratins, collagens, myosins, and elastins. Hair and the outer layer of skin are composed of keratin. Connective tissues contain collagen. Myosins are muscle proteins and are capable of contraction and extension. Elastins are found in ligaments and the elastic tissue of artery walls. Globular proteins, the other major class, are soluble in aqueous media. In these proteins, the chains are folded so that the molecule as a whole is roughly spherical. Familiar examples include egg albumin from egg whites and serum albumin in blood. Serum albumin plays a major role in transporting fatty acids and maintaining a proper balance of osmotic pressures in the body. Hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are important for binding oxygen, are also globular proteins."
Melting ice is drastically impacting the number of what at glacier national park?,icebergs,gaisers,trees,active glaciers,"In Glacier National Park ( Figure below ), many glaciers have become ice sheets. In 1850, the park had 150 glaciers. There are only about 25 today. The reason that there is so much melting is that summer temperatures have risen. Scientists estimate that the park will have no active glaciers as early as 2020."
What element is present in all organic molecules?,hydrogen,oxygen,sodium,carbon,"The Carbon Cycle Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in living organisms. Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms. Carbon compounds contain energy, and many of these compounds from plants and algae have remained stored as fossilized carbon, which humans use as fuel. Since the 1800s, the use of fossil fuels has accelerated. As global demand for Earth’s limited fossil fuel supplies has risen since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased as the fuels are burned. This increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and is a major environmental concern worldwide."
A sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout itself is known as what?,molecule,antimatter,essence,substance,"A sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout is called a substance. Sometimes the phrase pure substance is used, but the word pure isn’t needed. The definition of the term substance is an example of how chemistry has a specific definition for a word that is used in everyday language with a different, vaguer definition. Here, we will use the term substance with its strict chemical definition. Chemistry recognizes two different types of substances: elements and compounds. An element is the simplest type of chemical substance; it cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by ordinary chemical means. There are about 115 elements known to science, of which 80 are stable. (The other elements are radioactive, a condition we will consider in Chapter 15 ""Nuclear Chemistry"". ) Each element has its own unique set of physical and chemical properties. Examples of elements include iron, carbon, and gold."

Projections from the cell body are either dendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. Some glial cells are also shown. Astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently. Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron. Some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue. A nerve consists of neurons and glial cells."
Hydrogen-based fuel cells were and are used to provide what for manned space vehicles?,gravity,light,magnetism,electricity,"Hydrogen-based fuel cells were and are used to provide electricity for manned space vehicles, partly because their only chemical product is water, which could be used for drinking. However, there has been a recent resurgence in interest in fuel cells because of their potential use in electric cars. Most electric cars run on conventional batteries, which can be very heavy and expensive to replace. It is thought that fuel cells, rather than conventional batteries, might be better sources of electricity for automobiles. Several current barriers to fuel cell use in electric cars include capacity, cost, and overall energy efficiency. The 2008 Honda FCX, the first production model of a vehicle powered with a fuel cell, can hold 4.1 kg (just under 9 lb) of highly pressured H2 gas and has a range of 450 km (280 mi). It costs about $120,000–$140,000 to build, making the vehicle beyond the ability of most people to own. Finally, it always requires more energy to produce elemental hydrogen as a fuel than can be extracted from hydrogen as a fuel. As such, hydrogen is described as an energy carrier (like electricity) rather than an energy source (like oil and gas). This distinction points out a fundamental argument against fuel cells as a “better” power source."
What are plants that are adapted to very dry environments called?,sporozoans,succulents,pores,xerophytes,"Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem: how to get and keep water.

"Associated with hair follicles, what type of oil gland is found all over the body and helps to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair?",gametes gland,sweat gland,melanin gland,sebaceous gland,"Sebaceous Glands A sebaceous gland is a type of oil gland that is found all over the body and helps to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair. Most sebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles. They generate and excrete sebum, a mixture of lipids, onto the skin surface, thereby naturally lubricating the dry and dead layer of keratinized cells of the stratum corneum, keeping it pliable. The fatty acids of sebum also have antibacterial properties, and prevent water loss from the skin in low-humidity environments. The secretion of sebum is stimulated by hormones, many of which do not become active until puberty. Thus, sebaceous glands are relatively inactive during childhood."

What is the transfer of heat by physical contact?,diffusion,oxidation,inhibition,conduction,"Heat can be transferred in three ways, through conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of heat by physical contact. Heat flows form the hotter object to the cooler object. Convection is heat transfer by an intermediate substance (for example air or water). Your oven (often properly called the ‘convection oven’) works by heating up the air and then the air heats up your food. Radiation is the release of heat (and thus the lowering of its internal energy) by releasing electromagnetic waves. The hotter the object the higher the frequency of the light emitted. When you look at a fire the blue flames our hotter than the red flames because blue has a higher frequency than red."
"What analytical technique, using stained gel, can separate dna fragments or rna molecules and proteins?",static electrophoresis,microwave electrophoresis,surface electrophoresis,gel electrophoresis,"Gel electrophoresis is an analytical technique used to separate DNA fragments by size and charge. Notice in Figure below that the ""gels"" are rectangular in shape. The gels are made of a gelatin-like material of either agarose or polyacrylamide. An electric field, with a positive charge applied at one end of the gel, and a negative charge at the other end, forces the fragments to migrate through the gel. DNA molecules migrate from negative to positive charges due to the net negative charge of the phosphate groups in the DNA backbone. Longer molecules migrate more slowly through the gel matrix. After the separation is completed, DNA fragments of different lengths can be visualized using a fluorescent dye specific for DNA, such as ethidium bromide. The resulting stained gel shows bands correspond to DNA molecules of different lengths, which also correspond to different molecular weights. Band size is usually determined by comparison to DNA ladders containing DNA fragments of known length. Gel electrophoresis can also be used to separate RNA molecules and proteins."

Development includes the process of differentiation, in which unspecialized cells become specialized in structure and function to perform certain tasks in the body. Development also includes the processes of growth and repair, both of which involve cell differentiation. Growth is the increase in body size. Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the number of existing cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around cells (such as mineral deposits in bone), and, within very narrow limits, increasing the size of existing cells. Reproduction is the formation of a new organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is carried out by the male and female reproductive systems. Because death will come to all complex organisms, without reproduction, the line of organisms would end."
Toxins and poisons are ______ enzyme inhibitos,observable,reversible,cancerous,irreversible,
How many types of basic sensory receptors are there?,four,five,six,five,
What bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons?,metallic,polar,hydrogen,covalent,A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two atoms that share a pair of valence electrons. Covalent bonds form only between atoms of nonmetals.
"Above the meristem, the rest of the root is covered with a single layer of what type of cells, which may have root hairs?",vegetative,dermal,single celled,epidermal,"Above the meristem, the rest of the root is covered with a single layer of epidermal cells. These cells may have root hairs that increase the surface area for the absorption of water and minerals from the soil. Beneath the epidermis is ground tissue, which may be filled with stored starch. Bundles of vascular tissues form the center of the root. Waxy layers waterproof the vascular tissues so they don’t leak, making them more efficient at carrying fluids. Secondary meristem is located within and around the vascular tissues. This is where growth in thickness occurs."
What were the first plants to evolve?,trees,fungi,photoreactive plants,nonvascular plants,Nonvascular plants were the first plants to evolve and do not have vascular tissue.
What term describes the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves?,variation,frequency,threshold,wavelength,Another important measure of wave size is wavelength. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves (see Figure above ). Wavelength can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests of a transverse wave or two adjacent compressions of a longitudinal wave. It is usually measured in meters. Wavelength is related to the energy of a wave. Short-wavelength waves have more energy than long-wavelength waves of the same amplitude. You can see examples of waves with shorter and longer wavelengths in Figure below .
What break down dead organisms and other organic waste and release inorganic molecules back to the environment called?,carnivores,detritivores,nematodes,decomposers,Decomposers break down dead organisms and other organic wastes and release inorganic molecules back to the environment.
The variety of cell shapes seen in prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the functions that each what has?,organ,proteins,life,cell,"The variety of cell shapes seen in prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the functions that each cell has, confirming the structure-function relationship seen throughout biology. Each cell type has evolved a shape that is best related to its function. For example, the neuron in Figure below has long, thin extensions ( axons and dendritres ) that reach out to other nerve cells. The extensions help the neuron pass chemical and electrical messages quickly through the body. The shape of the red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) enable these cells to easily move through capillaries . The spikes on the pollen grain help it stick to a pollinating insect or animal so that it can be transferred to and pollinate another flower. The long whip-like flagella (tails) of the algae Chlamydomonas help it swim in water."
What is the science of classifying living things called?,botany,methodology,terminology,taxonomy,"Like you, scientists also group together similar organisms. The science of classifying living things is called taxonomy. Scientists classify living things in order to organize and make sense of the incredible diversity of life. Modern scientists base their classifications mainly on molecular similarities. They group together organisms that have similar proteins and DNA. Molecular similarities show that organisms are related. In other words, they are descendants of a common ancestor in the past."
"Illustrating how form follows function, long, slender protein strands that make up what tissue are essential for contracting and relaxing?",ligaments,tendons,veins,muscle,"Although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. The secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein’s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. When they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. Denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. The contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic."
What makes marginal lands unsuitable for farming?,disease,flood,pestilence,drought,"Many lands are marginal for farming. When rainfall is normal or high, the lands can produce. When rainfall is low, no crops grow. Drought makes marginal lands unsuitable for farming. Drought can also make good lands more difficult to farm. These changes will increase as temperatures warm."
What happens to water when it freezes?,changes volume,changes to gas,it shrinks,it expands,"In its pure liquid form, water is a poor conductor of electricity. Unlike most substances, water is more dense in its liquid state than its solid state. As a result, water expands when it freezes, and ice floats on water."
"The three parts of the human small intestine is the duodenum, jejunum, and what?",cecum,appendix,colon,ileum,"Which of the following statements about the small intestine is false? a. Absorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli, small projections that increase surface area and aid in the absorption of food. The inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi. Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels. The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen. The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The “C-shaped,” fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in Figure 34.11. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices break down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum. The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 34.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum."
What is the term for the ability of a fluid to exert an upward force on any object placed in it?,resonance,viscosity,density,buoyancy,Buoyancy is the ability of a fluid to exert an upward force on any object placed in it. The upward force is called buoyant force. An object’s weight and the buoyant force acting on it determine whether the object sinks or floats. Less dense objects and fluids float in fluids with greater density.
A fuel cell is a galvanic cell that requires a constant external supply of what?,complexes,generators,electricity,reactants,"Fuel Cells A fuel cell is a galvanic cell that requires a constant external supply of reactants because the products of the reaction are continuously removed. Unlike a battery, it does not store chemical or electrical energy; a fuel cell allows electrical energy to be extracted directly from a chemical reaction. In principle, this should be a more efficient process than, for example, burning the fuel to drive an internal combustion engine that turns a generator, which is typically less than 40% efficient, and in fact, the efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40% and 60%. Unfortunately, significant cost and reliability problems have hindered the wide-scale adoption of fuel cells. In practice, their use has been restricted to applications in which mass may be a significant cost factor, such as US manned space vehicles. These space vehicles use a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell that requires a continuous input of H2(g) and O2(g), as illustrated in Figure 19.16 ""A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Produces Electrical Energy Directly from a Chemical Reaction"". The electrode reactions are as follows: Equation 19.93."
"Lichens are not a single organism, but rather an example of a what?",symbiosis,fusion,homogeneous mixture,mutualism,"Lichens are not a single organism, but rather an example of a mutualism, in which a fungus (usually a member of the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla) lives in close contact with a photosynthetic organism (a eukaryotic alga or a prokaryotic cyanobacterium) (Figure 24.23). Generally, neither the fungus nor the photosynthetic organism can survive alone outside of the symbiotic relationship. The body of a lichen, referred to as a thallus, is formed of hyphae wrapped around the photosynthetic partner. The photosynthetic organism provides carbon and energy in the form of carbohydrates. Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, contributing nitrogenous compounds to the association. In return, the fungus supplies minerals and protection from dryness and excessive light by encasing the algae in its mycelium. The fungus also attaches the symbiotic organism to the substrate."
What theory states that there is no interaction between individual gas particles?,Avoidance theory,viscosity theory,vortex theory,kinetic theory,"The kinetic theory also states that there is no interaction between individual gas particles. Although we know that there are, in fact, intermolecular interactions in real gases, the kinetic theory assumes that gas particles are so far apart that the individual particles don’t “feel” each other. Thus, we can treat gas particles as tiny bits of matter whose identity isn’t important to certain physical properties."
Which is one of the most frequently studied cartilaginous fish?,manatees,whales,dolphins,sharks,Sharks are some of the most frequently studied cartilaginous fish. Sharks are distinguished by such features as:.
A vapor light produces visible light by what process?,Solar Energy,solutes,luminescent,electroluminescence,"A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting."
"What substance, which forms igneous rock, flows out in rivers of lava when it reaches the surface?",fertilizer,granite,soil,magma,"The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava."
What do mammals have under the skin to help insulate the body?,cartilage,bone,nerve cells,a layer of fat,"Conserving heat is also important, especially in small mammals. A small body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size. Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals. Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. It traps a layer of warm air next to the skin. Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin, so it becomes an even better insulator (see Figure below ). Mammals also have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body. This fatty layer is not found in other vertebrates."
Certain air pollutants form which liquid when dissolved in water droplets in the air?,citrus,water,base,acid,"Acidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7. Fish may also need a pH between 6 and 7. Certain air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets in the air. This results in acid fog and acid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower. The pH chart in the Figure above and the Figure below reveal some of the adverse effects of acid fog and rain. Acid rain not only kills trees. It also lowers the pH of surface waters such as ponds and lakes. As a result, the water may become too acidic for fish and other water organisms to survive."
What element is the most abundant in the universe?,helium,oxygen,carbon,hydrogen,"Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is a component of more compounds than any other element. Water is the most abundant compound of hydrogen found on earth. Hydrogen is an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats, oils, alcohols, acids, and thousands of other substances. At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the diatomic molecule H2. Hydrogen is composed of three isotopes, and unlike other elements, these isotopes have different names and chemical symbols: protium, 1H, deuterium, 2H (or “D”), and tritium 3H (or “T”). In a naturally occurring sample of hydrogen, there is one atom of deuterium for every 7000 H atoms and one atom of radioactive tritium for every 1018 H atoms. The chemical properties of the different isotopes are very similar because they have identical electron structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their differing atomic masses. Elemental deuterium and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen. Consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, D2O, yields deuterium. Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions."

"Animals are heterotrophs, which means that they cannot make their own what?",habitat,fuel,energy,food,"Animals are a kingdom of multicellular eukaryotes. They cannot make their own food. Instead, they get nutrients by eating other living things. Therefore, animals are heterotrophs."
What is the electron domain geometry of ammonia?,neurons,membranes,atoms,tetrahedral,"Another example of sp 3 hybridization occurs in the ammonia (NH 3 ) molecule. The electron domain geometry of ammonia is also tetrahedral, meaning that there are four groups of electrons around the central nitrogen atom. Unlike methane, however, one of those electron groups is a lone pair. The resulting molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal. Just as in the carbon atom, the hybridization process starts as a promotion of a 2s electron to a 2p orbital, followed by hybridization to form a set of four sp 3 hybrids. In this case, one of the hybrid orbitals already contains a pair of electrons, leaving only three half-filled orbitals available to form covalent bonds with three hydrogen atoms."

The earth's gravitational force causes the moon to do what?,lose orbit,overlap the earth,change size,orbit the earth,"= 2.72×10 −3 m/s. 2 The direction of the acceleration is toward the center of the Earth. Discussion The centripetal acceleration of the Moon found in (b) differs by less than 1% from the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity found in (a). This agreement is approximate because the Moon’s orbit is slightly elliptical, and Earth is not stationary (rather the Earth-Moon system rotates about its center of mass, which is located some 1700 km below Earth’s surface). The clear implication is that Earth’s gravitational force causes the Moon to orbit Earth."

Under what type of conditions can populations grow exponentially?,lush,pleasant,useful,ideal,"Under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially. The growth rate increases as the population gets larger. Most populations do not live under ideal conditions and grow logistically instead. Density-dependent factors slow population growth as population size nears the carrying capacity."
Malonate plays what negative role on the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase?,receptor,catalyst,pathway,inhibitor,
How many mass extinctions have occurred throughout earth's history?,three,six,four,five,"Extinction is the complete dying out of a species. Once a species goes extinct, it can never return. More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct. Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earth’s history. They were caused by major geologic and climatic events. The fifth mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago."
What refers to the ability to change or move matter and is required by all life processes and living things?,enthalpy,fuel,gravity,energy,"Energy is the ability to change or move matter. All life processes require energy, so all living things need energy."

It’s a good example of lateral continuity. You can clearly see the same rock layers on opposite sides of the canyon. The matching rock layers were deposited at the same time, so they are the same age."
What do we call the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum?,electricity,weight,radio,light,Earth is just a tiny speck in the universe. Our planet is surrounded by lots of space. Light travels across empty space. Astronomers can study light from stars to learn about the universe. Light is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum . Astronomers use the light that comes to us to gather information about the universe.
What type of crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor?,warm,exotic,endotopic,oceanic,"There are two kinds of crust. Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm 3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor."
Do changes to rocks happen quickly or slowly?,slowly then quickly,quickly then slowly,quickly,slowly,"All rocks on Earth change, but these changes usually happen very slowly. Some changes happen below Earth’s surface. Some changes happen above ground. These changes are all part of the rock cycle. The rock cycle describes each of the main types of rocks, how they form and how they change. Figure below shows how the three main rock types are related to each other. The arrows within the circle show how one type of rock may change to rock of another type. For example, igneous rock may break down into small pieces of sediment and become sedimentary rock. Igneous rock may be buried within the Earth and become metamorphic rock. Igneous rock may also change back to molten material and re-cool into a new igneous rock."

Major advances in technology have influenced every aspect of life, including transportation, food production, manufacturing, communication, medicine, and the arts. That’s because technology has the goal of solving human problems, so new technologies usually make life better. They may make work easier, for example, or make people healthier. Sometimes, however, new technologies affect people in negative ways. For example, using a new product or process might cause human health problems or pollute the environment."
Prokaryotes can reproduce quickly by what?,residual fission,multiple fission,solar fission,binary fission,
What is defined by its sequence of nucleotides?,amino acids,structural acids,proteins acids,nucleic acids,"Like proteins, nucleic acids have a primary structure that is defined as the sequence of their nucleotides. Unlike proteins, which have 20 different kinds of amino acids, there are only 4 different kinds of nucleotides in nucleic acids. For amino acid sequences in proteins, the convention is to write the amino acids in order starting with the Nterminal amino acid. In writing nucleotide sequences for nucleic acids, the convention is to write the nucleotides (usually using the one-letter abbreviations for the bases, shown in Figure 19.5 ""Structure of a Segment of DNA"") starting with the nucleotide having a free phosphate group, which is known as the 5′ end, and indicate the nucleotides in order. For DNA, a lowercase d is often written in front of the sequence to indicate that the monomers are deoxyribonucleotides. The final nucleotide has a free OH group on the 3′ carbon atom and is called the 3′ end. The sequence of nucleotides in the DNA segment shown in Figure 19.5 ""Structure of a Segment of DNA"" would be written 5′-dGdT-dA-dC-3′, which is often further abbreviated to dGTAC or just GTAC."
What in roundworms is a partial body cavity filled with fluid?,spicule,abdomen,cocklebur,pseudocoelom,"Ancestors of roundworms also evolved a pseudocoelom. This is a partial body cavity that is filled with fluid. It allows room for internal organs to develop. The fluid also cushions the internal organs. The pressure of the fluid within the cavity provides stiffness. It gives the body internal support, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. It explains why roundworms are round and flatworms are flat. Later, a true coelom evolved. This is a fluid-filled body cavity, completely enclosed by mesoderm. It lies between the digestive cavity and body wall (see Figure below ). Invertebrates with a true coelom include mollusks and annelids."
Which body system breaks down food and absorbs nutrients?,hormonal system,skeletal system,circulation system,digestive system,"The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food and absorbs nutrients. It also gets rid of solid food waste. The digestive system is mainly one long tube from the mouth to the anus, known as the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). The main organs of the digestive system include the esophagus, stomach and the intestine, and are pictured below ( Figure below ). The intestine is divided into the small and large intestine. The small intestine has three segments. The ileum is the longest segment of the small intestine, which is well over 10 feet long. The large intestine is about 5 feet long."

What occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic?,desalinization,ocean vaporization,acid rain,ocean acidification,"Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume."
What kind of muscle is the heart mainly composed of?,nerve muscle,respiratory muscle,idealized muscle,cardiac muscle,"To move blood through the heart, the cardiac muscle needs to contract in an organized way. Blood first enters the atria ( Figure below ). When the atria contract, blood is pushed into the ventricles. After the ventricles fill with blood, they contract, and blood is pushed out of the heart. The heart is mainly composed of cardiac muscle. These muscle cells contract in unison, causing the heart itself to contract and generating enough force to push the blood out."

The process uses carbon dioxide and water and also produces oxygen. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:.
"When present in large volumes, what color hue can water emit?",yellow,white,pink,blue,"Water is truly an amazing substance. It can exist in all three states under normal pressures and temperatures. At room temperature, it is a tasteless, odorless, colorless liquid, although it exhibits a blue hue when present in large volumes. Approximately 70% of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. For a small molecule, water molecules are highly attracted to one another, due to particularly strong hydrogen bonds. This leads to a number of properties, such as a relatively high surface tension. Unlike most other substances, water expands when it freezes. Water is also able to absorb relatively large amounts of heat with only minimal changes in temperature. This can be seen on a small scale, such as the coolant in your car, or on a larger scale, such as the more moderate climates in coastal areas. The water in the oceans acts as a tremendous heat sink, which influences global weather patterns. The clouds that form above lakes and oceans originate from the evaporation of lake and ocean water. They are byproducts of water’s thermal regulating capacity. Additionally, water is not only found here on Earth; scientists have found evidence of water on a number of extraterrestrial planets. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at this unique and important substance."
What prevents new ovarian follicles from developing and suppresses uterine contractility?,estrogen,germination,glucose,progesterone,"28.4 Maternal Changes During Pregnancy, Labor, and Birth Hormones (especially estrogens, progesterone, and hCG) secreted by the corpus luteum and later by the placenta are responsible for most of the changes experienced during pregnancy. Estrogen maintains the pregnancy, promotes fetal viability, and stimulates tissue growth in the mother and developing fetus. Progesterone prevents new ovarian follicles from developing and suppresses uterine contractility. Pregnancy weight gain primarily occurs in the breasts and abdominal region. Nausea, heartburn, and frequent urination are common during pregnancy. Maternal blood volume increases by 30 percent during pregnancy and respiratory minute volume increases by 50 percent. The skin may develop stretch marks and melanin production may increase."
What type of bombs put a much larger fraction of their output into thermal energy than do conventional bombs?,TNT,dense bombs,dirty bombs,nuclear,"The energy yield and the types of energy produced by nuclear bombs can be varied. Energy yields in current arsenals range from about 0.1 kT to 20 MT, although the Soviets once detonated a 67 MT device. Nuclear bombs differ from conventional explosives in more than size. Figure 32.34 shows the approximate fraction of energy output in various forms for conventional explosives and for two types of nuclear bombs. Nuclear bombs put a much larger fraction of their output into thermal energy than do conventional bombs, which tend to concentrate the energy in blast. Another difference is the immediate and residual radiation energy from nuclear weapons. This can be adjusted to put more energy into radiation (the so-called neutron bomb) so that the bomb can be used to irradiate advancing troops without killing friendly troops with blast and heat."
"The majority of elements, including iron and copper, are of what type?",minerals,oils,acids,metals,"There are almost 120 known elements. As you can see from Figure below , the majority of elements are metals. Examples of metals are iron (Fe) and copper (Cu). Metals are shiny and good conductors of electricity and heat. Nonmetal elements are far fewer in number. They include hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). They lack the properties of metals."
What happens to water vapor as it rises?,it disperses,it warms,it vibrates,it cools,"The image below shows the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle ( Figure below ). Water vapor rises from Earth’s surface into the atmosphere. As it rises, it cools. The water vapor may then condense into water droplets and form clouds.

Prophase is preceded by a preprophase stage in what type of cells?,egg cells,brain cells,hair and nail cells,plant cells,"As plant cells have some structural differences compared to an animal cell, an additional stage prior to prophase is necessary. In plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a preprophase stage. Plant cells have a large central vacuole encompassing the center of the cell. Prior to the division of the nucleus, the nucleus must migrate to the center of the plant cell. To accomplish this, the cell forms a phragmosome , a sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the middle of the cell. The phragmosome suspends the cell nucleus in the center of the cell in preparation for prophase. Additionally, during this phase the plane of cell division is established. The accurate control of division planes, which establishes the placement of the future cell wall, is crucial for the correct structure of plant tissues and organs."

What is it called when birds keep their eggs warm while the embryos inside develop?,fertilization,insulation,spawning,incubation,"After birds lay their eggs, they generally keep the eggs warm with their body heat while the embryos inside continue to develop. This is called incubation, or brooding . In most species, parents stay together for at least the length of the breeding season. In some species, they stay together for life. By staying together, the males as well as females can incubate the eggs and later care for the hatchlings . Birds are the only nonhuman vertebrates with this level of male parental involvement."

The ladybug and the frog both start as eggs and go through what process?,proboscis,transition,parthenogenesis,metamorphosis,
What formula  shows only the kinds and numbers of atoms in a molecule?,nucleus formula,plasma formula,atomic formula,molecular formula,"We use several kinds of formulas to describe organic compounds. A molecular formula shows only the kinds and numbers of atoms in a molecule. For example, the molecular formula C4H10 tells us there are 4 carbon atoms and 10 hydrogen atoms in a molecule, but it doesn’t distinguish between butane and isobutane. A structural formula shows all the carbon and hydrogen atoms and the bonds attaching them. Thus, structural formulas identify the specific isomers by showing the order of attachment of the various atoms. Unfortunately, structural formulas are difficult to type/write and take up a lot of space. Chemists often use condensed structural formulas to alleviate these problems. The condensed formulas show hydrogen atoms right next to the carbon atoms to which they are attached, as illustrated for butane:."

Asteroids are not geologically active. which is the only way they can change?,expansion,propulsion,combustion,a collision,"Asteroids are very small, irregularly shaped, rocky bodies. Asteroids orbit the Sun, but they are more like giant rocks than planets. Since they are small, they do not have enough gravity to become round. They are too small to have an atmosphere. With no internal heat, they are not geologically active. An asteroid can only change due to a collision. A collision may cause the asteroid to break up. It may create craters on the asteroid’s surface. An asteroid may strike a planet if it comes near enough to be pulled in by its gravity. Figure below shows a typical asteroid."

"Animal behavior can be said to be controlled by genetics and experiences, also known as nature and what?",interaction,growth,evolution,nurture,"In reality, most animal behaviors are not controlled by nature or nurture. Instead, they are influenced by both nature and nurture. In dogs, for example, the tendency to behave toward other dogs in a certain way is probably controlled by genes. However, the normal behaviors can’t develop in an environment that lacks other dogs. A puppy raised in isolation from other dogs may never develop the normal behaviors. It may always fear other dogs or act aggressively toward them."

What is an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets called?,diploid,autotrophs,autosome,polyploid,"In an individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes, cellular mechanisms will inactivate all but one X in each of her cells. As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop. Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-X, appear female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY chromosome complement, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. The extra X chromosome undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 chromosome complement (i. , only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility. An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called polyploid. For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Triploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally with an odd number of chromosome sets. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species."
Most of the fresh water on earth is tied up in a solid form. what are they called?,oceans,sediments,lakes,glaciers,"Most of Earth’s water is salt water in the oceans. As Figure below shows, only 3 percent of Earth’s water is fresh. Freshwater is water that contains little or no dissolved salt. Most freshwater is frozen in ice caps and glaciers. Glaciers cover the peaks of some tall mountains. For example, the Cascades Mountains in North America and the Alps Mountains in Europe are capped with ice. Ice caps cover vast areas of Antarctica and Greenland. Chunks of ice frequently break off ice caps. They form icebergs that float in the oceans."

The hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates what two systems?,connectors and nervous,Pathway and nervous,marrow and nervous,endocrine and nervous,"Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis The hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain. It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses to environmental changes. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control. The pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or “master gland” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in Figure 37.15. It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk (or infundibulum). The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions—the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary—which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland contains axons of the hypothalamic neurons."
What type of biomes have water containing little or no salt?,marine biomes,coastal biomes,aquatic biomes,freshwater biomes,Freshwater biomes have water that contains little or no salt.

The energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom is called?,fission energy,vapor energy,potential energy,ionization energy,"Summary The tendency of an element to lose or gain electrons is one of the most important factors in determining the kind of compounds it forms. Periodic behavior is most evident for ionization energy (I), the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom. The energy required to remove successive electrons from an atom increases steadily, with a substantial increase occurring with the removal of an electron from a filled inner shell. Consequently, only valence electrons can be removed in chemical reactions, leaving the filled inner shell intact. Ionization energies explain the common oxidation states observed for the elements. Ionization energies increase diagonally from the lower left of the periodic table to the upper right. Minor deviations from this trend can be explained in terms of particularly stable electronic configurations, called pseudo noble gas configurations, in either the parent atom or the resulting."
"The four basic types of tissue are epithelial, muscle, connective, and what?",circulatory,regulatory,digestive,nervous,"A tissue is a group of connected cells that have a similar function within an organism.

In what form is atmospheric sulfur found?,sulfur monoxide,formaldehyde,sulfuric acid,sulfur dioxide (so2),"On land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and geothermal vents (Figure 20.17). Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and as rain falls through the atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout. Also, as sulfur-containing rocks weather, sulfur is released into the soil. These rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. Terrestrial ecosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates (SO42-), which enter the food web by being taken up by plant roots. When these plants decompose and die, sulfur is released back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas."
